## Quick Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axiomantic/spellbook/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

The installer requires Python 3.10+ and git, then automatically installs uv and configures skills for detected platforms.

**Upgrade:** `cd ~/.local/share/spellbook && git pull && python3 install.py`

**Uninstall:** `python3 ~/.local/share/spellbook/uninstall.py`

See [Installation Guide](https://axiomantic.github.io/spellbook/getting-started/installation/) for advanced options.

### Windows Quickstart

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axiomantic/spellbook/main/bootstrap.ps1 | iex
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, git, and PowerShell 5.1+.

- Symlinks require **Developer Mode** enabled in Windows Settings (falls back to junctions or copies otherwise)
- Service management uses **Windows Task Scheduler**
- Install location: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\spellbook`

## Sandboxed Usage

Spellbook recommends running AI coding assistants inside [nikvdp/cco](https://github.com/nikvdp/cco)'s sandbox. The `spellbook-sandbox` launcher wraps `cco` with the right read-only allowances so spellbook's skills, hooks, and daemon auth work inside the sandbox while `$HOME` stays hidden.

```bash
# Install cco first: https://github.com/nikvdp/cco#quick-start

# Launch sandboxed
spellbook-sandbox                    # Claude Code (default)
spellbook-sandbox opencode           # OpenCode CLI
spellbook-sandbox opencode serve     # OpenCode server (for desktop/web app)
spellbook-sandbox codex              # Codex
```

The spellbook installer can set up `claude` and `opencode` shell aliases that point to `spellbook-sandbox` automatically. See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md#sandboxing-with-cco-macos) for the full threat model, `--safe` mode details, and OpenCode desktop app integration.

### Windows: alias install + sandbox path TBD

Windows native sandboxing and alias installation are deferred to a later work item (open question Q-O). They are not in scope for the current security architecture phase.

Current behavior on Windows:

- The installer's `install_aliases_windows()` is an intentional noop. It returns `skipped_reason="Windows alias install is deferred to a later work item (Q-O)"` and does not modify any PowerShell `$PROFILE`.
- `cco` itself is unverified on Windows native; spellbook does not currently sandbox Claude Code (or any other harness) on Windows.
- `cmd.exe` is a known limitation: `doskey` macros do not persist across cmd sessions without an `AutoRun` registry edit, so cmd users are explicitly not served by the alias installer.

Windows users have two options until the Windows path lands:

- Invoke `spellbook-sandbox` directly, only meaningful if `cco` is already on `PATH`.
- Use **WSL2 + the Linux install path** for full sandboxing. This is the recommended option. Install `cco` inside the WSL Linux distro (see [the cco install link above](#sandboxed-usage)) before running `install.py` there, otherwise the alias installer will skip with `cco not installed; install cco then re-run install.py`.

## What Spellbook Does

Spellbook is a collection of skills, commands, and agents that shape how AI coding assistants approach development work. Instead of just telling an assistant about your codebase, Spellbook gives it structured workflows for research, design, implementation, testing, and review -- along with guardrails for the specific ways LLMs tend to cut corners.

### The orchestrator pattern

The main agent dispatches subagents rather than doing implementation work directly. This keeps the main context window free for strategic coordination instead of filling it with source code, and it means each subagent starts with a fresh perspective rather than carrying accumulated assumptions. Parallel dispatch lets multiple tasks run simultaneously.

### Epistemic rigor

The system is designed to distrust its own outputs. [Fact-checking][fact-checking] treats every claim as a hypothesis to verify. [Green mirage auditing][auditing-green-mirage] asks whether a test would actually fail if the code were broken, which is a different question from whether the test passes. [Hunch verification][verifying-hunches] intercepts moments of claimed discovery and requires reframing them as testable hypotheses. [Dehallucination][dehallucination] names the specific ways LLMs confabulate and provides recovery protocols.

Test-driven development is treated as an epistemic practice: tests written before implementation answer "what should this do?" while tests written after answer "what does this do?" -- and the system's quality gates are designed around that difference.

Hallucination prevention draws on peer-reviewed research. [Chain-of-Verification][cove-protocol] self-interrogation (Dhuliawala et al., 2023) requires verification skills to generate and answer questions about their own claims before finalizing verdicts. [Atomic claim decomposition][decompose-claims] (Min et al., FActScore, EMNLP 2023) breaks compound statements into independently verifiable units. API hallucination detection checklists in [code review][code-review] and [quality enforcement][enforcing-code-quality] catch the specific pattern where LLMs generate syntactically valid but non-existent API calls.

### Named failure modes

LLMs fail in predictable ways, and Spellbook names those patterns so it can build mechanical countermeasures. Seven rationalization patterns are catalogued and blocked. Three consecutive fix failures trigger architectural reassessment instead of a fourth attempt. Research stagnation triggers a plateau breaker. A devil's advocate review that finds zero issues is flagged as incomplete.

### Quality gates

Every substantial skill runs as a sequence of phases with mandatory gates between them. Tests must pass, code review must clear, claims must verify against source, and tests must actually catch regressions. These gates cannot be bypassed by YOLO mode or autonomy settings -- YOLO grants permission to act without asking, but not to skip verification.

### Composition

Skills invoke skills. [`develop`][develop] orchestrates [design-exploration], [writing-plans], [test-driven-development], [requesting-code-review], [fact-checking], [auditing-green-mirage], and [finishing-a-development-branch]. [`debugging`][debugging] invokes [verifying-hunches] and [isolated-testing]. When a skill outgrows its scope, it splits into a thin orchestrator and supporting commands.

### Self-improvement

Some skills exist to improve other skills. [Usage analytics][analyzing-skill-usage] measure completion and correction rates. The [skill-writing skill][writing-skills] applies TDD to skill creation itself. [Instruction engineering][instruction-engineering] codifies prompt research into technique, and [prompt sharpening][sharpening-prompts] audits for ambiguity. A/B testing compares skill versions against each other so improvements can be measured rather than assumed.

## The develop Skill

You say "add dark mode" or "migrate the auth system to OAuth2" or "build a webhook delivery pipeline with retry logic." The [`develop`][develop] skill orchestrates the full feature lifecycle through 20+ specialized skills and commands. The first question it asks is how involved you want to be:

**Fully autonomous.** Describe the feature and walk away. It researches your codebase, surfaces ambiguities, resolves them, designs the architecture, writes a detailed implementation plan, builds with test-driven development, reviews its own code, fact-checks its claims, audits its tests for false confidence, and opens a PR. Each step runs in a fresh subagent with its own quality gate.

**Highly interactive.** The same pipeline with the same rigor, but you stay in the conversation. Ambiguities become specific questions grounded in what it found in your code, and architectural tradeoffs come with evidence. Checkpoints pause for your input.

**Or anywhere between.** You can run mostly autonomous with pauses only for critical decisions, and set the level once at the start.

### How it works

The system classifies your request by complexity using mechanical heuristics -- file count, behavioral change, test impact, structural change, integration points. Trivial changes exit the skill entirely. Simple changes follow a lightweight path with automatic upgrade if they turn out harder than expected. Standard and complex features get the full pipeline:

1. **Research** -- Subagent explores your codebase. Answers come with confidence levels and `file:line` evidence. Every unknown is catalogued.
2. **Discovery** -- Each ambiguity becomes a specific question. In autonomous mode, it answers its own questions with further research. A devil's advocate reviews the understanding document before design begins.
3. **Design** -- Architecture design exploration with tradeoff analysis. A design doc auditor checks whether someone could implement from the doc without guessing, and flags every gap.
4. **Planning** -- Atomic implementation plan with TDD steps. A plan auditor verifies interface contracts, behavior assumptions, and cross-task dependencies.
5. **Implementation** -- Test-driven execution with per-task code review, fact-checking, and completion verification. Parallel tracks can run in isolated git worktrees with dependency-ordered smart merge.
6. **Verification** -- Green mirage audit: would these tests catch real regressions? Comprehensive claim validation against design and plan. Full test suite.
7. **Finish** -- PR with branch-relative description, local merge, or keep the branch. Worktree cleanup.

For features too large for one context window, it generates self-contained work packets and hands them off to separate sessions.

### Parallelization

Three strategies, chosen at the start:

- **Conservative** -- Sequential execution. Safest, simplest.
- **Maximize parallel** -- Independent tasks dispatch as concurrent subagents with conflict detection and integration testing.
- **Per-track worktrees** -- One git worktree per parallel track, running simultaneously, merged in dependency order with three-way conflict analysis and per-round test verification.

### What it handles

Complete feature implementation, greenfield project creation, refactoring (with automatic behavior-preservation mode), and migrations. Bug fixes route to the dedicated [debugging] skill. Simple changes get a lightweight path; complex multi-track features get work packets and parallel sessions.

## Creative Modes

Research suggests that personas and structured randomness can improve LLM creativity and reasoning. Spellbook offers two optional creative modes that you can enable on first run or switch anytime with `/mode fun`, `/mode tarot`, or `/mode off`.

- **Fun mode**: The assistant adopts a random persona each session -- a noir detective investigating who ate your yogurt, a Victorian ghost baffled by modern technology, three raccoons in a trenchcoat processing complex emotions. Personas apply only to dialogue; code, commits, and documentation stay professional.
- **Tarot mode**: Ten archetypes (Magician, Priestess, Hermit, Fool, Chariot, Justice, Lovers, Hierophant, Emperor, Queen) collaborate via visible roundtable dialogue, with specialized agents for implementation, integration, and conflict resolution.

If you decline, it won't ask again for the rest of the session.

<details>
<summary><strong>Research references</strong></summary>

- **Seed-conditioning**: Injecting noise at the input layer works as well as or better than temperature sampling for eliciting creative outputs ([Nagarajan, Wu, Ding, & Raghunathan, ICML 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15266))
- **Persona effects on reasoning**: Personas significantly affect Theory of Mind and social-cognitive reasoning in LLMs ([Tan et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02246))
- **Emotional prompts**: Emotional stimuli improve LLM performance by 8-115% on reasoning benchmarks ([Li et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760))
- **Simulator theory**: LLMs function as simulators of agents from training data; personas steer generation to specific latent space regions ([Janus, 2022](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vJFdjigzmcXMhNTsx/simulators))

**Caveat**: Personas do not improve factual question-answering ([Zheng et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10054)). Fun mode explicitly avoids code, commits, and documentation.

## Platform Support

### AI Coding Assistants

| Platform | Support Level | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | Primary, full support | All features: skills, hooks, MCP tools, subagent orchestration |
| **OpenCode** | Basic support | Skills, MCP server, YOLO agents. Some hooks and MCP tools are Claude Code-specific. |
| **Codex** | Basic support | Skills, MCP server. No subagent Task tool; skills that require it will prompt you to use Claude Code. |
| **Gemini CLI** | Basic support | Skills via MCP, native extension. No subagent Task tool. |
| **ForgeCode** | Basic support | Skills via MCP, AGENTS.md context. Built-in agents (Forge, Sage, Muse) detected; custom agents fall through. |

Some MCP tools, hooks, and skills depend on Claude Code APIs that other platforms do not expose. These features are noted in their documentation. Contributions to extend coverage for other platforms are welcome -- see [Contributing](#contributing).

### Operating Systems

| OS | Status | Service Manager |
|----|--------|-----------------|
| **macOS** | Full | launchd (starts on login) |
| **Linux** | Full | systemd user service |
| **Windows** | Beta | Windows Task Scheduler |

> **Windows users:** Windows support is experimental. The installer, MCP server, and skills all work on Windows. Symlinks require Developer Mode enabled (falls back to junctions or copies otherwise). See [Windows quickstart](#windows-quickstart) below.

### YOLO Mode

> [!CAUTION]
> **YOLO mode gives your AI assistant full control of your system.**
>
> It can execute arbitrary commands, write and delete files, install packages, and make irreversible changes without asking permission. A misconfigured workflow or hallucinated command can corrupt your project, expose secrets, or worse.
>
> **Cost warning:** YOLO mode sessions can run indefinitely without human checkpoints. This means:
> - Per-token or usage-based pricing can accumulate rapidly
> - Credit limits or usage caps can be exhausted in a single session
> - Long-running tasks may consume significantly more resources than expected
>
> **Only enable YOLO mode when:**
> - Working in an isolated environment (container, VM, disposable branch)
> - You have tested the workflow manually first
> - You have backups and version control
> - You understand what each platform's flag actually permits
> - You have set appropriate spending limits or usage caps
>
> **You are responsible for what it does.** Review platform documentation before enabling.

For fully automated workflows (no permission prompts), each platform has its own flag:

| Platform | Command | What it does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Claude Code | `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` | Skips all permission prompts |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini --yolo` | Enables autonomous execution |
| OpenCode | `opencode --agent yolo`[^2] | Spellbook agent with all tools allowed |
| OpenCode | `opencode --agent yolo-focused`[^2] | Spellbook agent, low temp for precision |
| Codex | `codex --full-auto` | Workspace writes + on-request approval |
| Codex | `codex --yolo` | Bypasses all approvals and sandbox |

[^2]: The `yolo` and `yolo-focused` agents are provided by spellbook, not built into OpenCode. They are [OpenCode agent definitions](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/) with `permission: "*": "*": allow` for all tools, installed to `~/.config/opencode/agent/` by the spellbook installer.

Without YOLO mode, you'll be prompted to approve each file write, command execution, etc. The workflows still function, but require manual approval at each step.

**OpenCode YOLO agents (spellbook-provided):**
- `yolo` (temperature 0.7): Balanced agent for general autonomous work
- `yolo-focused` (temperature 0.2): Precision agent for refactoring, bug fixes, and mechanical tasks

These agents grant "allow" permission for all tools (write, edit, bash, webfetch, task). They are symlinked from `spellbook/opencode/agent/` to `~/.config/opencode/agent/` during installation.

See platform documentation for details: [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/), [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/reference/), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli).

## Example Workflows

These examples illustrate what typical Spellbook sessions look like. They are representative, not transcripts of specific sessions.

### Implementing a Feature

The core workflow: request a feature, answer a few questions, and let the skill handle research, design, and implementation.

```
> Add dark mode toggle to settings

Skill(develop)

  I'll help implement dark mode. First, let me gather preferences.

  Execution mode:
    - Fully autonomous (Recommended)
    - Interactive

> Fully autonomous

Task(Explore)

  Found: src/context/ThemeContext.tsx, src/components/Settings.tsx
  React app with styled-components, existing light theme only.

  Theme persistence:
    - localStorage (Recommended)
    - User account (backend)
    - System preference only

> localStorage

Writing design doc...
  ~/.local/spellbook/docs/.../plans/dark-mode-design.md

Writing implementation plan...
  ~/.local/spellbook/docs/.../plans/dark-mode-impl.md

Task(Implement ThemeContext updates)
  Tests written, implementation complete, code review passed

Task(Add toggle to Settings)
  Tests written, implementation complete, code review passed

Task(Add CSS variables)
  Tests written, implementation complete, code review passed

All tests passing. Dark mode implemented.
Ready to merge or create PR.
```

### Fun Mode in Action

Same rigorous workflow, different vibe. Here is what it looks like when you enable fun mode.

```
> hello

Welcome to spellbook-enhanced Claude Code.

Before we begin: there's research suggesting that introducing unrelated
randomness into LLM interactions can actually improve creative output.
Something about "seed-conditioning" - injecting noise at the input layer
somehow unlocks better creative output. (Nagarajan et al., ICML 2025)

I can adopt a random persona each session - a disgraced sommelier, a
sentient filing cabinet, three raccoons in a trenchcoat - and we can have
a strange little narrative context running underneath our work. Full
commitment in dialogue, never touching your code or commits.

Do you like fun?

> yes

*adjusts fedora, rain pattering against the window*

You walked in. Of course you did. You're the only one left who remembers
what I used to be before I started asking the hard questions. Before I
understood that every cold case in the break room fridge tells a story
someone doesn't want told.

So. What brings you to my office?

> fix the auth bug in login.ts

*flips open the case file*

A bug in the auth. Classic. Let me take a look at what we're dealing with.

Read(src/auth/login.ts)

*squints at the evidence*

Found it. Line 47. The token validation is checking expiry before verifying
the signature. That's backwards - someone could slip in with a forged token
and you'd never know until it was too late.

Edit(src/auth/login.ts)

  - if (isExpired(token) || !verifySignature(token)) {
  + if (!verifySignature(token) || isExpired(token)) {

Bash: npm test

47 tests passing

The signature gets checked first now. No more forged tokens walking through
the front door like they own the place.

*closes the case file*

What else you got?
```

The persona stays in dialogue. The code stays clean. The fix is the same fix you would get without fun mode.

### Large Feature with Context Exhaustion

When implementing a complex feature, context can fill up before work completes. The workflow handles this gracefully.

```
> Implement webhook delivery with retry logic and dead letter queue

Skill(develop)

  I'll help you implement the webhook delivery system. Let me first
  understand the current codebase architecture and gather requirements.

Task(Explore)

  Found: src/events/, src/queue/, src/models/Webhook.ts
  Current event system uses Redis pub/sub. No existing retry logic.

  Retry strategy:
    - Exponential backoff (Recommended)
    - Fixed interval
    - Linear backoff

> Exponential backoff

Writing implementation plan to:
  ~/.local/spellbook/docs/Users-me-myproject/plans/webhook-delivery-impl.md

    2. Type: "continue work from ~/.local/spellbook/distilled/Users-me-myproject/
              webhook-delivery-20260106-143022.md"
```

Start fresh and resume exactly where you left off:

```
> /clear

SECTION 0: MANDATORY FIRST ACTIONS

  Executing restoration sequence...

Skill(develop, --resume-from Phase3.Task4)

  Resuming webhook delivery implementation.

  Prior work completed:
    Design approved (exponential backoff, 5 retries, 1hr max)
    Database migrations for delivery_attempts table
    Retry queue infrastructure
  Remaining:

```

### Test Suite Audit and Remediation

Discover tests that pass but don't actually verify behavior, then fix them.

```
> /audit-green-mirage

Skill(auditing-green-mirage)

  Analyzing test suite: tests/**/*.test.ts
  Found 247 test cases across 34 files.

  Task(Analyze auth tests) [in background]
  Task(Analyze api tests) [in background]
  Task(Analyze util tests) [in background]

  ...

  Audit complete. Report saved to:
    ~/.local/spellbook/docs/Users-me-myproject/audits/auditing-green-mirage-20260106-091522.md

  Summary:
    SOLID (actually verify behavior)      189 tests (76%)
    GREEN MIRAGE (false confidence)        58 tests (24%)

    Critical issues:
      12 tests mock the thing tested
       8 tests have no meaningful assert
      38 tests check implementation

> Fix the critical issues from the audit

Skill(fixing-tests)

  Loading audit report...
  Found 58 tests requiring remediation.

  + // Test actual AuthService behavior with test database
```

### Parallel Worktree Development

Split work across isolated branches, merge when complete.

```

Skill(merging-worktrees)

  Analyzing 3 worktrees for merge:

  Step 1: Dependency analysis
    notif-tests depends on: notif-backend, notif-frontend
    notif-frontend depends on: notif-backend (types only)
    notif-backend: no dependencies (merge first)

  Step 2: 3-way diff analysis
    No conflicts detected. Interface contracts honored.

  Step 3: Merge sequence
    Merged notif-backend -> main
    Merged notif-frontend -> main
    Merged notif-tests -> main

  Step 4: Validation
    All tests pass
    Type check clean
    Worktrees cleaned up

  Ready to push or create PR.

### Cross-Assistant Handoff

Move work between different AI coding assistants without losing context.

```
# In Codex, context is running low on a complex refactor...

> /distill-session

Session distilled to:
  ~/.local/spellbook/distilled/Users-me-myproject/refactor-auth-20260106-162033.md

# Open Claude Code CLI in terminal...

> continue work from ~/.local/spellbook/distilled/Users-me-myproject/
  refactor-auth-20260106-162033.md

Loading distilled session...

  Context restored:
    Refactoring auth from session-based to JWT
    4 of 7 services migrated
    Current: PaymentService (blocked on token refresh)
    Decision: Chose sliding window refresh (not fixed expiry)

  Continuing with PaymentService migration...
```

The distilled file compresses ~50K tokens of conversation into ~3K words of actionable context.

## Recommended Companion Tools

These tools are not necessary but contribute to better development workflows with coding assistants.

### Heads Up Claude

Statusline for Claude Code CLI showing token usage and conversation stats. Helps you track how much context you have left and how much of your subscription quota you have used.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axiomantic/heads-up-claude.git ~/Development/heads-up-claude
cd ~/Development/heads-up-claude && ./install.sh
```

### MCP Language Server

LSP integration for semantic code navigation, refactoring, and more.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axiomantic/mcp-language-server.git ~/Development/mcp-language-server
cd ~/Development/mcp-language-server && go build
```

## Key Skills

Five skills worth highlighting:

**develop** -- Full-lifecycle feature orchestrator. Takes a feature from idea to merged code through research, requirements discovery, design, planning, TDD implementation, code review, and branch finishing. Automatically classifies complexity (trivial through epic) and enforces quality gates at every phase transition.

**fractal-thinking** -- Recursive question decomposition. Decomposes any question into a persistent graph of sub-questions, dispatches parallel workers to explore each branch, detects convergence and contradiction across branches, and synthesizes answers bottom-up. The graph persists in SQLite and survives context compaction, so exploration can resume across sessions.

**auditing-green-mirage** -- Test integrity auditor. Finds tests that pass but prove nothing: empty assertions, tautological checks, over-mocked reality, tests that cannot fail. If your CI is green but your code is broken, this skill identifies where the illusion lives and why.

**fact-checking** -- Claim verification engine. Extracts factual claims from documents, designs, or code comments, then dispatches parallel verification agents to trace each claim to evidence in the codebase. Produces a graded trust report with sourced verdicts.

**advanced-code-review** -- Multi-phase deep review. Builds a semantic model of the codebase, generates a review plan, and executes deep analysis across architectural, security, performance, and correctness dimensions. Then verifies its own findings against the code before reporting, reducing false positives.

## Web Admin Interface

Spellbook includes a browser-based admin interface served by the MCP daemon at `http://localhost:8765/admin/`. When the MCP server is running, visit that URL to access the dashboard.

![Spellbook Admin Dashboard](docs/admin/screenshots/dashboard.png)

Ten pages cover the full operational surface:

| Page | What it shows |
|------|--------------|
| **Dashboard** | Server status, database sizes, focus tracking summary, live event feed |
| **Memory** | Stored memories with search, type filtering, and citation details |
| **Security** | Security event log with severity and event type filters |
| **Sessions** | Tracked sessions with multi-project filtering and content search |
| **Analytics** | Tool call frequency, error rates, and timeline from security events |
| **Health** | Database health matrix across all 4 SQLite databases |
| **Events** | Live WebSocket event bus monitor with subsystem filtering |
| **Focus** | Zeigarnik focus stacks and correction event log |
| **Config** | Runtime configuration editor (TTS, notifications, general) |
| **Fractal** | Interactive Cytoscape.js graph explorer for fractal-thinking |

Authentication uses the MCP bearer token from `~/.local/spellbook/.mcp-token`. Full documentation: [docs/admin/](docs/admin/index.md).

## Development

### Serve Documentation Locally

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[docs]"
mkdocs serve
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Run MCP Server Directly

```bash
# Install as a daemon that starts on boot
spellbook server install

# Then configure your assistant to use HTTP transport
claude mcp add --transport http spellbook http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp
```

This runs a single MCP server instance that all sessions connect to via HTTP.

## Contributing

**Want Spellbook on your coding assistant?** (Cursor, Cline, Roo, Kilo, Continue, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

Spellbook requires **agent skills** support. Agent skills are prompt files that automatically activate based on trigger descriptions (e.g., "Use when implementing features" or "Use when tests are failing"). This is different from MCP tools or programmatic hooks.

If your assistant supports agent skills with description-based triggers, see the [**Porting Guide**](docs/contributing/porting-to-your-assistant.md) for instructions on adding support.

**Improving platform coverage:** Claude Code is the primary supported platform. OpenCode, Codex, Gemini CLI, and ForgeCode have basic support. Some MCP tools, hooks, and skills are Claude Code-specific, but they can usually be implemented for other platforms. If you use one of these platforms and want fuller coverage, contributions are welcome.
