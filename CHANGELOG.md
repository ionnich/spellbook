# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.63.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added

- **`agent2agent` skill: filesystem-based message bus for inter-Claude-session
  communication.** Each registered name owns an inbox at
  `$AGENT2AGENT_DIR/<name>/{inbox,processed,sent}/` (default
  `~/.local/share/agent2agent`). Messages are JSON files written atomically
  (tempfile + rename) with timestamped, lexicographically-sortable filenames.
  Sessions opt in by running the helper's `listen <name>` subcommand once,
  which both creates the inbox tree and records a per-session binding at
  `<bus>/.bindings/<session-id>` keyed by `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`.
- **Hook integration via session-id binding.** `spellbook_hook.py`'s
  `UserPromptSubmit` handler now invokes the helper's `notify` subcommand
  for any session with a recorded binding and prepends a one- or two-line
  `[agent2agent]` notice to the turn's context when mail is waiting. Notices
  surface only metadata (count + sender names) — message bodies are NEVER
  auto-injected. Reading a body requires the agent to deliberately invoke
  the helper's `read` / `peek` / `check` subcommands, which the SKILL.md
  documents must treat as untrusted input. Stale bindings (binding present
  but inbox dir gone) clean themselves up silently inside `notify`. The hook
  fails open: missing helper, subprocess timeout, or any unexpected
  exception leaves the session uninterrupted.
- **`tests/test_hooks/test_agent2agent_hook.py`**: subprocess-driven
  integration tests covering empty-inbox silence, multi-message metadata
  surfacing (with body-leak assertion), unbound-session silence, stale
  binding cleanup, and helper-script-missing tolerance.

## [0.62.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **`permissions-from-transcripts` skill** (`skills/permissions-from-transcripts/SKILL.md`).
  Re-runnable workflow that wraps the WI-2 YOLO transcript analyzer.
  Backed by a shared library at `spellbook/gates/transcript_analyzer.py`
  so the skill, the script, and any future caller share one classification
  pipeline. The script `scripts/analyze_yolo_transcripts.py` is now a
  thin CLI wrapper.
- **bashlex AST parser** (`spellbook/gates/bash_parser.py`). Walks a
  bashlex parse tree and emits deny findings for compound commands,
  command substitution, dangerous redirects (e.g. `> /dev/tcp/...`,
  `>> /etc/...`, `> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys`), env-prefix escapes
  (`GIT_PAGER=...`, `GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=...`, `PAGER=...`), shell-out
  flags (`find -exec`, `xargs sh -c`, `git -c core.pager=`,
  `git -c alias.X=!`), direct shell invocation (`eval`, `sh -c`,
  `bash -c`), and wrapper-stripping bypasses (`timeout`, `nohup`,
  `npx`, `mise`, `docker run`). Unknown AST node types fail closed
  with audit-log entries under `~/.local/spellbook/logs/audit.jsonl`.
  Wired into the PreToolUse hook before the legacy regex layers.
  Adds a `bashlex>=0.18` runtime dependency.
- **Reversibility tier classifier and L2 permissions derivation**
  (`spellbook/gates/tiers.py`, `spellbook/gates/tiers.toml`).
  Maps each tool call to a reversibility tier (T0 silent / T1 loud /
  T2 ask / T3 deny / T_UNCLASSIFIED) using a TOML-seeded record table.
  The same tier projection produces an L2 deny list installed into
  `settings.json` by the installer; the in-process gate is the runtime
  mirror of that policy. Emits TIER-DENY (CRITICAL) and TIER-ASK
  (HIGH) findings; T_UNCLASSIFIED falls through to the regex layer.
  Initial seed covers 20 records spanning bash literals, alternation
  expansions, MCP tool patterns, and capability tools.
- **Read-tool secret-path denylist** (`spellbook/gates/secret_paths.py`).
  Blocks reads of `~/.ssh/*`, `~/.aws/*`, `~/.config/op/*`, `~/.netrc`,
  macOS browser credential stores, Windows %APPDATA%/1Password and
  Chrome user data, plus basename globs `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.pem`,
  `*.key`, `id_rsa[.*]`, `id_ed25519[.*]`. Resolves the file_path
  through symlinks before matching so a symlink at a "safe" path that
  points into `~/.ssh` is still denied.

### Changed

- **Bash policy unified across Claude and Gemini paths.** Renamed
  `hooks/gemini-policy.toml` to `hooks/bash-policy.toml`. Added a TOML
  loader to `spellbook/gates/rules.py` so the Claude path picks up the
  supplemental SB-BASH-* rules previously only consumed by the Gemini
  installer. Old filename is preserved as a migration alias for one
  release. SB-BASH-001..009 ship as additional defense-in-depth findings
  on top of the existing BASH-* / EXF-* regex set.
- **PR dance command** (`commands/pr-dance.md`) now explicitly refuses
  to merge under any session-level autonomy directive ("yolo", "do the
  PR dance autonomously", "just land it", "go go go"). Autonomy scopes
  commit / push / comment / re-request-review only. Tag-push and
  branch deletion are also out of scope until explicitly requested.
- **`crystallize-consolidate` documentation page** added under
  `docs/commands/` (`scripts/generate_docs.py` output that had not been
  committed). Stale skill and command doc pages regenerated in the
  same pass.

### Removed

- **No-em-dashes prohibition rule.** Removed from `AGENTS.spellbook.md`
  (and from the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` outside the repo).
  Descriptive references to em-dashes in writing guides and AI-tone
  detection notes are preserved.

## [0.61.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **YOLO transcript analyzer** (`scripts/analyze_yolo_transcripts.py`).
  Scans Claude Code session JSONLs under `~/.claude-work/projects/` and
  `~/.claude/projects/` (both by default; `--config-dir PATH` repeatable
  to override) for successful Bash invocations, buckets them by
  `(first-token, sorted -flag tokens)`, and proposes a
  `permissions.allow` array of gitignore-style patterns
  (`Bash(git status:*)`, etc.) grouped into five safety categories:
  read-only, search/inspect, build/test idempotent, local file/cache,
  and local git mutation. Mutating commands (`git push`, `gh pr merge`,
  `gh pr close`, `acli jira workitem transition`, `acli jira workitem
  edit`) are explicitly rejected and surfaced in a separate
  `rejected_mutating` section so reviewers can see what was filtered.
  Output is written to `~/.local/spellbook/state/proposed_allow_list.json`
  with deterministic key ordering, plus a human-readable summary on
  stdout. The script never writes `settings.json` directly — the
  proposal is intended for review before being fed into
  `install_permissions(allow=...)` from Phase 0. Subagent transcripts
  under `<session>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl` are walked alongside main
  sessions; failed Bash invocations (paired `tool_result.is_error`) are
  filtered out before bucketing.

## [0.60.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **Installer manages `defaultMode` and `permissions` blocks.** The
  Claude Code installer now writes a `defaultMode` entry and an
  installer-managed `permissions` block into `~/.claude/settings.json`
  and `~/.claude-work/settings.json`. Three new component modules drive
  this: `installer/components/default_mode.py`,
  `installer/components/permissions.py`, and
  `installer/components/managed_permissions_state.py` (a per-config-dir
  state file that records which entries the installer owns so unmanaged
  user-set values are preserved). `defaultMode` is set to `acceptEdits`
  for spellbook-managed config dirs; `defaultMode` values are validated
  against the Claude Code 2.1.x allowlist (`default`, `acceptEdits`,
  `plan`, `bypassPermissions`) at install time. `install_permissions` is
  wired but inert in this release (no managed entries yet); future
  phases populate the allow list (transcript-analyzer-derived) and the
  deny list (tier-projection-derived). Uninstall is symmetric: only
  installer-owned `defaultMode` and `permissions` entries are removed.
  Cross-bucket conflicts in user-supplied permission sets are
  warn-and-skip rather than fatal.
- **`windows_only` and `posix_only` pytest markers.** Lets installer
  and core tests gate themselves to the platform whose code path they
  exercise. Skipped tests now emit a clear reason rather than failing
  with platform-specific assertions.

### Changed

- **`installer/components/hooks.py` settings writes go through
  `atomic_write_json`.** Earlier writes used `Path.write_text`, which on
  Windows can lose data when an antivirus / Claude Code / another
  process holds an open handle on `settings.json` at rename time.
  `atomic_write_json` (and its underlying `atomic_replace`) carry a
  Windows transient-error retry budget that recovers from those
  `PermissionError` (WinError 5) and `FileNotFoundError` cases.

## [0.59.0] - 2026-05-01

### Changed

- **Batched dependabot bumps (23 PRs).** Single chore branch landing
  9 pip and 14 npm dependency updates that had accumulated as open
  dependabot PRs. Conflicts between sibling bumps (multiple PRs touching
  the same `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` / lockfile) were
  auto-resolved by taking the target package's incoming version and
  regenerating affected `package-lock.json` files via `npm install
  --package-lock-only`. Notable bumps: `sqlalchemy` >=2.0.49, `rich`
  >=15.0.0, `websockets` >=16.0, `fastapi` >=0.136.1, `uvicorn` >=0.46.0,
  `mkdocs-material` >=9.7.6, `mike` >=2.2.0, `dirty-equals` >=0.11,
  `pytest-timeout` >=2.4.0; frontend `vite` 8.0.10, `cytoscape` 3.33.2,
  `vitest` 4.1.5, `@types/node` 25.6.0, `@opencode-ai/{plugin,sdk}`
  1.14.29; major-version jumps `eslint` 9->10 and `typescript` 5->6
  (in `spellbook/admin/frontend`).

## [0.58.1] - 2026-05-01

### Changed

- **Tripwire dependency renamed on PyPI.** The dist name on PyPI changed from
  `python-tripwire` to `pytest-tripwire` as of upstream release 0.21.0.
  `pyproject.toml` dev deps now require `pytest-tripwire[http]>=0.21.0`. The
  Python import name remains `tripwire`; no test or source code change is
  needed beyond the dependency declaration. Documentation references in
  `AGENTS.md`, `.gemini/styleguide.md`, and the `dispatching-sub-orchestrators`
  skill were updated to match the new dist name.

## [0.58.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **`sub_orchestrators` execution mode for COMPLEX features.** New
  `dispatching-sub-orchestrators` skill introduces a CEO/Manager pattern
  for COMPLEX features (15+ tasks across 2+ tracks). The CEO orchestrator
  dispatches Manager subagents, each owning a coherent file scope and
  3-7 tasks; Managers run per-task gates inside their own context and
  return a single compact structured summary. Prevents context bloat in
  the develop orchestrator on large COMPLEX features where per-gate
  dispatching from a single CEO accumulated hundreds of summaries and
  degraded strategic oversight by mid-execution. The skill contains the
  canonical Manager Dispatch Template, the CEO loop, and the gotchas
  surfaced in real-world COMPLEX execution: Task-tool fallback to inline
  execution, single-worktree Manager serialization, file-ownership
  grouping vs wave grouping, and end-of-Phase-4 gates as the
  compensating safety net for inline execution.

### Changed

- **`feature-implement` Phase 3.4.5 selection logic** now picks
  `sub_orchestrators` when the feature is COMPLEX with 15+ tasks across
  2+ tracks. The mode slots between `delegated` and `work_items`: still
  single session, but interposes Manager subagents so the CEO no longer
  dispatches per-gate per-task directly. Phase 4 routing table lists
  all four execution modes; new section 4.0 dispatches a single
  subagent that invokes `dispatching-sub-orchestrators`, after which
  CEO resumes at 4.6.1 to run end-of-Phase-4 gates at CEO level.
- **`develop` SKILL.md** workflow overview, Phase 3 transition
  checklist, and COMPLEX tier routing now describe all four execution
  modes (`work_items` / `sub_orchestrators` / `delegated` / `direct`)
  and when each applies. `direct`, `delegated`, and `work_items`
  behavior is unchanged.
- **`dispatching-parallel-agents` SKILL.md** gains a Sub-Orchestrator
  (Manager) Dispatch subsection that points to
  `dispatching-sub-orchestrators` as the canonical home for the Manager
  Dispatch Template and CEO loop, without inlining the template.
- **Execution mode routing decoupled from complexity tier.** Phase 3.4.5
  selection of `sub_orchestrators` and `work_items` now keys solely off
  `num_tasks` and `num_distinct_tracks`, not `complexity_tier`. The
  complexity tier continues to gate which workflow phases run (SIMPLE
  skips gathering-requirements / design / devils-advocate); execution
  mode is independent. Resolves an inconsistency where
  `feature-implement` Phase 3.4.5 allowed `sub_orchestrators` for any
  feature exceeding task thresholds while several skill/doc files
  described it as COMPLEX-only.
- **Gates list expanded.** The end-of-Phase-4 gate range cited in the
  sub_orchestrators skill and feature-implement Phase 4 routing now reads
  `4.6.1 - 4.6.5` (was `4.6.1 - 4.6.4`), correctly including the Pre-PR
  Claim Validation gate.
- **Mocking framework example updated.** The sub_orchestrators skill's
  mocking guidance no longer references the retired `bigfoot` package; it
  now defers to AGENTS.md and points at python-tripwire as the canonical
  example.
- **Phase 3.4.5 routing order corrected.** The `work_items` predicate for
  very large features with dependent tracks (`num_tasks > 25`) now
  precedes the `sub_orchestrators` predicate, so cross-session
  decomposition wins for the largest cases instead of being shadowed by
  the single-session sub_orchestrators path.
- **Pre-Dispatch Ritual cross-references added.** The CEO loop in
  `dispatching-sub-orchestrators` and the Subagent Dispatch Template in
  `dispatching-parallel-agents` now explicitly remind the dispatcher to
  perform the Phase Declaration ritual defined in `develop` before each
  `Task()` invocation.

## [0.57.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **PR Review Bot details.** Adds bot username and re-review command instructions to `AGENTS.md`.

### Changed

- **README and docs positioning.** Reframes user-facing documentation to
  articulate Spellbook as a harness-augmentation layer that runs across
  coding harnesses (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini CLI, ForgeCode),
  rather than a peer product. Surfaces three differentiators on the front
  page: harness-agnostic, shared centralized MCP server for cross-harness
  state continuity, and a skills+hooks layer no individual harness ships
  natively. Touches `README.md`, `docs/index.md`,
  `docs/getting-started/{platforms,quickstart}.md`, `AGENTS.spellbook.md`,
  and `pyproject.toml`.
- **`pyproject.toml` description shortened** for package registry
  compatibility. The harness list was dropped from the description
  field (registries may truncate around 100-120 chars); the full list
  remains in the README and `docs/index.md` taglines.

### Removed

- **bigfoot dependency dropped; full migration to tripwire.**
  tripwire 0.20.0 (formerly bigfoot) deprecated the old name. Main
  landed a transitional state with both packages dual-listed; this
  release finishes the migration. Removes the `bigfoot[http]`
  dependency from `pyproject.toml`, renames all `import bigfoot` /
  `from bigfoot.*` to `tripwire` across 57 Python files (tests,
  conftest, one runtime docstring), updates the AGENTS.md
  mocking-rule section and `[tool.tripwire]` example snippet, and
  drops the rebrand-transition section from `.gemini/styleguide.md`
  (one reviewer guardrail mentioning bigfoot is retained so PRs
  reintroducing the old name are flagged).

### Added

- **Narrowing-role subagents (security architecture Phase 5).** Nine
  new agents in `agents/` define narrowed tool surfaces for common
  development verbs: `implementer` for worktree edits, `web-researcher`
  (requires Phase 8 devcontainer to be safe in production),
  `git-committer` and `git-pusher` for split local/remote git, separate
  `pr-creator`/`pr-merger` for `gh pr` operations, `jira-reader`/
  `jira-mutator` for Atlassian MCP read vs. write, and `test-runner`
  for scoped test invocations. Each agent's `tools:` frontmatter is a
  *narrowing* list — `(parent_tools ∩ frontmatter_tools)` — and never
  grants capabilities the parent does not already hold. Agents are
  discovered via `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/agents/`; spellbook's installer
  now creates per-config-dir symlinks back to `$SPELLBOOK_DIR/agents/`,
  with idempotent install/uninstall that preserves user-authored agent
  files. Schema-validation tests guard the canonical 5-section body
  contract (`Purpose` / `Tools` / `Output Schema` / `Guardrails` /
  `Constraints`) and SHA-256-snapshot the existing 7 agents to catch
  unintended modification.

- **`installer/components/spellbook_cco.py` component (security
  architecture Phase 5).** New installer component clones the
  `elijahr/cco` fork at audit-pinned SHA `d7044ef` to
  `~/.local/spellbook/cco/` and writes the
  `~/.local/bin/spellbook-cco` wrapper. Pin verification is enforced
  by default; `SPELLBOOK_INSTALLER_SKIP_FORK_PIN=1` bypasses it with
  a stderr `WARNING` line so accidental drift is loud.
- **macOS L5 sandbox layer ships via the fork's hardened SBPL
  profile.** The `spellbook-cco` wrapper applies the fork's profile,
  which adds DYLD environment scrub, file-read denies for
  user-writable dylib paths (preventing `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`-style
  injection), scoped `process-exec` deny+re-allow, and
  `mach-priv-task-port` deny. macOS now reaches feature parity with
  the Linux sandbox path rather than no-opping.
- **`SPELLBOOK_SANDBOX_SKIP_PIN=1` escape hatch.** Renamed from
  `SPELLBOOK_SANDBOX_SKIP_CCO_PIN=1`; the old name is still accepted
  for one release with a stderr `DEPRECATION` warning, then removed.

### Changed

- **`installer/platforms/claude_code.py` macOS path.** No longer
  no-ops; chains `install_spellbook_cco` then `install_aliases` so
  macOS users get the same hardened sandbox surface as Linux users.
- **`installer/tui.py` and `install.py` detection.** The TUI / CLI
  installer now probes for `spellbook-cco` on `PATH` instead of
  vanilla `cco`, so re-runs of the installer correctly identify
  prior spellbook-managed installs.
- **`scripts/spellbook-sandbox` gating.** The sandbox launcher gates
  on `spellbook-cco` (not vanilla `cco`) and verifies the audit-pinned
  `d7044ef` SHA by parsing `spellbook-cco --version` output. A version
  mismatch fails closed with a remediation hint.
- **`docs/security.md` retitled.** Section is now "Sandboxing with
  spellbook-cco (Linux + macOS)". Manual install instructions removed
  in favor of `install.py`, which is now the single source of truth
  for sandbox setup on both platforms.
- **`README.md` cco onboarding rewritten.** Instructions reference
  `spellbook-cco` rather than vanilla `cco`, and point at `install.py`
  instead of the upstream `nikvdp/cco` repo for installation.

### Rollback

- **`SPELLBOOK_USE_VANILLA_CCO=1` falls back to vanilla
  `nikvdp/cco`.** If the hardened fork breaks something on your
  system, set this env var to revert to the upstream vanilla `cco`
  binary. **This bypasses the hardened SBPL profile and DYLD scrub**,
  so only use it long enough to recover, then unset the env var and
  re-run `install.py` so the spellbook-managed sandbox is restored.

## [0.56.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **ForgeCode harness support (basic tier).** ForgeCode
  (tailcallhq/forgecode) joins Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and
  Gemini CLI as a 5th supported harness. Includes a dedicated
  `ForgeCodeInstaller` that writes Claude-Code-style top-level
  `mcpServers` to `<config_dir>/.mcp.json` (created with `0o600`
  atomically), an AGENTS.md demarcated section, MCP health-check
  integration, daemon CLI-tools list registration, and post-install
  TUI/CLI messaging. The installer honors `$FORGE_CONFIG`, prefers a
  legacy `~/forge` directory when pre-existing, and falls back to
  `~/.forge` by default. Self-identification signal is the system
  prompt opening with `You are Forge`, `You are Sage`, or
  `You are Muse`.

### Changed

- **`.gemini/styleguide.md` updated for the python-tripwire 0.20+
  rebrand.** bigfoot 0.21 is a thin namespace shim re-exporting
  python-tripwire; the `_mock` suffix on proxies was dropped and
  `[tool.tripwire]` is the canonical pyproject section. The styleguide
  now matches reality so contributor PRs are not flagged for
  conformance with stale aliases.
- **`pyproject.toml` dev deps** require `python-tripwire[http]`
  explicitly. The bigfoot 0.21 shim does not pull tripwire's `[http]`
  extra transitively, which surfaced as `ImportError: python-tripwire
  [http] is required` in CI.
- **Test suite migrated** from `bigfoot.{log,subprocess,db}_mock` to
  the renamed `bigfoot.{log,subprocess,db}` proxies (49 substitutions
  across 13 files) to track tripwire 0.20+.

## [0.55.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- **`/crystallize-consolidate` command** — operator-invoked rule
  bookkeeping for crystallize. Merges overlapping rules (with a
  `merged-from` provenance field), deprecates stale rules, and
  requires two-pass confirmation for removals. Operates only on the
  canonical `## Rules` section; never compresses General Instructions.
- **Crystallize Rules-section fixtures** under `tests/crystallize-fixtures/`:
  five fixture sets (mixed-format, no-rules, re-crystallize, byte-drift,
  mixed-tag-block) covering input detection, output emission, and
  byte-fidelity verification edge cases. Static input/expected pairs;
  no programmatic runner yet (disclosed in the fixture README).

### Changed

- **`crystallize` Rules / General split.** Crystallize now distinguishes
  lossless **Rules** (byte-preserved across passes, with provenance
  metadata) from synthesizable **General Instructions** (subject to
  normal compression). Detection is semantic with bias toward
  over-preservation. First-pass borderline content can be tightened
  with operator consent; in autonomous mode, tightening is silently
  skipped and surfaced in a `Tightening Skipped` delivery footer.
  Token-target arithmetic recomputes against
  `(total_bytes - rule_bytes)` with separate first-pass and
  re-crystallization envelopes plus a HALT floor enforced once in
  Post-Synthesis Verification.
- **`crystallize-verify` independent rule extractor.** The verifier no
  longer trusts the crystallizer's classification: any rule-shaped
  content present in the original but absent from the output Rules
  section is `CRITICAL`, regardless of how the crystallizer treated it.
  The verifier also accounts for consolidation via the `merged-from`
  field. Verifier read discipline preserved (only the two artifacts
  under review).
- **`optimizing-instructions` skill guard.** Inputs containing a
  `## Rules` heading are rejected with a redirect to `/crystallize`.
  The Rules-preservation carve-out is scoped to `crystallize` and
  `crystallize-consolidate`; `sharpen-improve` and other compression
  paths keep their own contracts.
- **`AGENTS.spellbook.md` Core Philosophy.** Adds *Steady correctness
  over speed — thoroughness is the default; speed is the exception
  that requires explicit operator instruction.* The existing
  **Develop = Thoroughness Mode** contract is positioned as a
  specialization of this umbrella.
- **`develop` skill phase non-fungibility hardened.** Adds a
  Pre-Dispatch Ritual that requires an explicit phase declaration
  before any subagent dispatch, bans the "subagents are HOW phases
  execute, not a substitute FOR phases" conflation in named-phrasing
  form, and codifies the thoroughness contract for Phase 4 gate
  sequencing (no batched gates across tasks).

## [0.54.1] - 2026-04-26

### Changed

- **Subagent skill dispatch contract hardened.** The canonical dispatch
  template in `dispatching-parallel-agents` now prohibits silent fallback:
  if the Skill tool is unavailable or the named skill is not in the
  catalog, the subagent must report the missing capability verbatim
  instead of inline-executing the skill from memory. The `develop`
  skill's "Subagent Skill Invocation Verification" block (mirrored in
  `commands/feature-implement.md` and `docs/skills/develop.md`) is now
  a hard REJECT rather than a prose-level "verify and re-dispatch",
  with explicit escalation when re-dispatch also fails.
- **Skill Availability by Agent Type matrix** added to
  `dispatching-parallel-agents`, documenting which subagent types
  (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`, `yolo`, `yolo-focused`) include
  the Skill tool and which (`claude-code-guide`, `statusline-setup`)
  do not. Includes the lazy-injection caveat: the skills catalog
  system-reminder is platform-injected after a subagent's first tool
  call, not at session start.
- **`AGENTS.spellbook.md` Skill Execution rules** now explicitly name
  the "subagents are HOW each phase executes, not a substitute FOR the
  phases" conflation as a forbidden anti-pattern.
- **`AGENTS.md` Adding Config Options section** added: three-point rule
  for new user-facing config keys (prompt new users, prompt existing
  users only if unset, never re-prompt once answered), divergent
  install entry-point parity requirement, idempotency pattern,
  non-tty fallback discipline, and `--reconfigure` flag guidance.
- **Bigfoot mocking rule hardened in `AGENTS.md`** with explicit
  forbidden/allowed lists. Narrows the `monkeypatch` allowlist to env
  vars, cwd, and `sys.path` only. Adds reviewer-phrasing guidance to
  prevent "use bigfoot OR monkeypatch" suggestions.

## [0.54.0] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Worker LLM** (opt-in, fully feature-flagged, all flags default OFF):
  first direct LLM integration in spellbook, targeting cheap
  OpenAI-compatible local endpoints (Ollama, vllm-mlx, LM Studio, etc.)
  for passive/augmentation tasks. Capabilities each gate independently:
  transcript-harvesting memory on the Stop hook (replace/merge/skip
  modes); PreToolUse safety sniff with fail-open on worker outage and
  a persistent on-disk block cache; memory rerank composition inside
  `memory_recall`; optional Claude-memory read-side merge via a new
  `claude_memory` scanner and schema translator.
- **`forge_roundtable_convene_local` MCP tool** (async) for
  worker-LLM-powered roundtable execution without orchestrator tokens.
- **`spellbook worker-llm doctor` CLI** probes config, transport,
  prompts, safety cache, event publish path, and feature flags.
- **Shared installer wizards** under `installer/wizards/`: `worker_llm`
  for the new subsystem, `defaults` covering 7 previously-unprompted
  config keys (`notify_*`, `auto_update`, `session_mode`,
  `profile.default`). Both install entry paths (root `install.py` and
  `spellbook/cli/commands/install.py`) now share the same wizards;
  previously they had drifted. `--reconfigure` bypasses the
  `config_is_explicitly_set` idempotency gate.
- **`profile.default` CONFIG_SCHEMA entry** (was invisible to the admin
  UI before).
- **Hybrid event transport**: in-daemon publishes use in-process
  `EventBus.publish`; subprocess callers POST to root
  `/api/events/publish` with bearer auth. Resolves events dropped when
  emitted from hook subprocesses.
- **Worker-prompt overrides**: four default prompts ship in the wheel
  and are overrideable via `~/.local/spellbook/worker_prompts/<task>.md`
  with a breadcrumb README.
- **`tests/conftest.py` autouse fixture** that isolates
  `worker_llm_*` config reads from the developer's real environment,
  preventing the "passes locally, fails for others" class of bug.
- **`fractal_claim_work(..., session_id=)`** parameter, documented in
  the skill, command, and mirrored docs. Enables linking a claimed node
  to the worker's chat log for replay in the admin UI.
- **AGENTS.md "Adding Config Options" section** with the three-point
  rule: prompt new users, prompt existing users on reinstall if still
  unset, never re-prompt once answered.
- **Pre-commit hook (`check-admin-frontend`)** staged for a future
  admin-frontend lint+typecheck path; currently inert.

### Changed

- **Bigfoot-only mocking rule hardened** in AGENTS.md and
  `.gemini/styleguide.md`. Rewrites the mocking section to document
  the register -> sandbox -> assert paradigm and the three guarantees.
  Narrows the `monkeypatch` allowlist to env vars, cwd, and sys.path
  only. Replaces fabricated plugin names (`bigfoot.database`,
  `bigfoot.socket`, `bigfoot.patch`, `@bigfoot.mock` decorator) with
  the real API surface from bigfoot 0.19.2. Documents
  `bigfoot.db_mock` as a state-machine plugin with step sentinels and
  `assert_*` methods. Adds explicit forbidden/allowed reviewer phrasings
  so automated reviewers cannot suggest `monkeypatch` or fabricated
  APIs without the guidance catching it.
- **All worker_llm test files migrated to bigfoot**
  (`test_config.py`, `test_events.py`, `test_events_publish_route.py`,
  `test_transcript_harvest.py`). `unittest.mock` usage eliminated from
  the worker_llm test suite. Non-callable `monkeypatch.setattr` uses
  on module state (bool flags, Path constants, int counters) retained
  — they fall outside the bigfoot mocking paradigm. One narrow
  `monkeypatch` carve-out in `test_transcript_harvest.py` documents a
  bigfoot `SocketPlugin` / `asyncio.run()` interaction limitation at
  bigfoot 0.19.2.

### Removed

- **TTS subsystem** (breaking change): `spellbook/tts/` (~6000 lines),
  `tts_speak`/`tts_status`/`tts_session_set`/`tts_config_set` MCP
  tools, the TTS installer wizard, the `--no-tts` install flag,
  daemon-venv provisioning for sounddevice/wyoming, the
  `tts_enabled`/`tts_voice`/`tts_volume` config keys, the `[tts]`
  optional dependency, PortAudio CI install, sounddevice/wyoming deps,
  11 TTS-only test files. The `audio-notifications` skill now covers
  only OS notifications.
- **MCP tool surface pruned from 96 to 65 tools** (breaking change,
  −27 tools):
  - Deleted unused domains: `messaging` (8 tools, 0 callers),
    `experiments` (7 tools, 0 callers). Domain modules in
    `spellbook/messaging/` and `spellbook/experiments/` also removed.
  - Deleted dead tools: `spellbook_check_compaction`,
    `spellbook_context_ping`, `analyze_skill_usage`,
    `spellbook_analytics_summary`, `spellbook_inject_test_reminder`.
  - Removed telemetry MCP triad: `spellbook_telemetry_enable`,
    `spellbook_telemetry_disable`, `spellbook_telemetry_status`.
  - Deleted `forge_roundtable_debate` and `forge_select_skill`
    (0 callers).
  - Deleted `forge_feature_update` and
    `forge_process_roundtable_response` (0 callers — neither
    referenced from any skill, command, doc, or OpenCode extension).
    Underlying library functions retained in `spellbook/forged/`
    because they still have internal callers.
- **`render_config_wizard` stub** and a `WIZARD_CONFIG_KEYS` key-name
  drift in the installer.
- **TTS-related dependabot groups** (kokoro, soundfile, sounddevice);
  `daemon-core` simplified to a catch-all.

### Fixed

- **`ContextVar _MEMORY_RECALL_ERROR`** surfaces worker failures to
  `memory_recall` callers without raising, preserving the contract
  that `memory_recall` never fails hard.
- **Hook subprocess event publish path**: subprocess-originated events
  (e.g., from hook scripts) previously dropped silently; now routed
  through `/api/events/publish` with bearer auth.
- **CI `python-tests` job**: removed the now-invalid
  `uv sync --group tts` and the PortAudio system-install step left
  behind after the TTS removal.
- **Windows CI failure in `test_memory_integration.py`**: the rerank
  mock response was built via f-string interpolation of a
  `pathlib.Path`, so Windows temp paths (`C:\Users\runneradmin\...`)
  embedded raw backslashes that were rejected as invalid JSON escape
  sequences. Switched the three affected construction sites to
  `json.dumps(...)` so paths round-trip cleanly on every platform.

### Breaking Changes

- **TTS removed.** Any user or extension that called `tts_speak`,
  `tts_status`, `tts_session_set`, or `tts_config_set` must adapt. The
  `[tts]` extra, `--no-tts` install flag, and
  `tts_enabled`/`tts_voice`/`tts_volume` config keys no longer exist.
- **27 MCP tools removed.** Callers of the messaging domain,
  experiments domain, telemetry triad, `forge_roundtable_debate`,
  `forge_select_skill`, `forge_feature_update`,
  `forge_process_roundtable_response`, and the dead utility tools
  listed under "Removed" must migrate or drop those calls.

### Track 6: Worker LLM Observability

- **`worker_llm_calls` SQLite-backed rolling log** records every worker
  LLM call for operator introspection. Writes happen fire-and-forget
  from two paths: `publish_call` on the in-daemon publish path and the
  `/api/events/publish` route handler on the subprocess path. Writes
  are sync SQLAlchemy, wrapped in best-effort try/except with
  first-failure-loud logging so a DB hiccup never interrupts a
  worker call but also never fails silently forever.
- **First Alembic migration for the spellbook DB**
  (`0001_add_worker_llm_calls`). `alembic.ini` was wired up with
  `version_locations` for per-DB subdirectories so
  `alembic upgrade -x db=spellbook` now actually applies migrations to
  the live DB. Prior to this change the spellbook DB had no migration
  history path even though the Alembic scaffolding existed.
- **`tool_safety` fail-open path unified.** The prompt-load
  short-circuit that previously emitted via `publish_fail_open` now
  goes through `publish_call(status='fail_open')`, which routes to a
  new `call_fail_open` event_type inside `publish_call`'s routing
  logic. This makes fail-open events visible to the new admin
  dashboard alongside successes and errors. The `publish_fail_open`
  helper itself is left in place for a post-audit cleanup pass.
- **Admin API**: `GET /api/worker-llm/calls` (paginated, filterable
  list) and `GET /api/worker-llm/metrics` (success rate, p95, p99,
  error breakdown, total).
- **Admin page `/admin/worker-llm`** with `WorkerLLMPage`,
  `MetricCard`, `ErrorBreakdownCard`, React Query hooks
  `useWorkerLLMCalls` + `useWorkerLLMMetrics`, and a Sidebar nav link
  "// WORKER LLM CALLS".
- **Background tasks registered in the daemon lifespan**:
  `purge_loop` (batched `DELETE ... LIMIT 500`, fresh session per
  batch, enforces `retention_hours` + `max_rows` caps) and
  `threshold_eval_loop` (edge-triggered desktop notifications via the
  existing `notifications.notify.send_notification` when the success
  rate drops below threshold over the last N calls; recovery
  notification fires on return to healthy).
- **Seven new `CONFIG_SCHEMA` / `CONFIG_DEFAULTS` keys**:
  `worker_llm_observability_retention_hours` (24),
  `worker_llm_observability_max_rows` (10000),
  `worker_llm_observability_purge_interval_seconds` (300),
  `worker_llm_observability_notify_enabled` (false),
  `worker_llm_observability_notify_threshold` (0.8),
  `worker_llm_observability_notify_window` (20),
  `worker_llm_observability_notify_eval_interval_seconds` (60).
- **`spellbook worker-llm doctor` extended** with an observability
  health check: reports `worker_llm_calls` table presence and row
  count, last-row timestamp, last-purge timestamp, and notification
  subsystem reachability.

### Track 7: Async Queue, Warm Probe, Hook Observability, Config Audit

- **Async worker queue** (opt-in): bounded `asyncio.Queue` with a daemon
  consumer task and drop-oldest overflow semantics. New
  `POST /api/worker-llm/enqueue` endpoint colocated with
  `/api/events/publish` at the MCP root. Fire-and-forget worker-LLM paths
  (transcript_harvest and the new tool_safety warm probe) enqueue when
  `worker_llm_queue_enabled=True` and fall back to the sync call
  otherwise. Each overflow drop publishes a `call` event with
  `status="dropped"` so queue pressure is observable in the admin UI.
  Two config keys: `worker_llm_queue_enabled` (default False) and
  `worker_llm_queue_max_depth` (default 256).
- **Warm probe for tool_safety** (PreToolUse): when the last successful
  worker-LLM call is older than `worker_llm_tool_safety_cold_threshold_s`
  (default 45s), the PreToolUse path skips the sniff (fail-open) and
  kicks off a background warmup enqueue. Prevents cold-start latency
  from stalling tool invocations while keeping the worker primed.
- **Hook execution observability**: new `hook_events` SQLite table (one
  row per dispatcher invocation) plus `/api/hooks/record`,
  `/api/hooks/events`, and `/api/hooks/metrics` endpoints. New
  `/admin/hooks` page renders metric cards (p50/p95 duration, success
  rate, recent event count) and a filterable event table. Retention
  governed by three config keys (`hook_observability_retention_hours`,
  `hook_observability_max_rows`,
  `hook_observability_purge_interval_seconds`) matching the worker-LLM
  observability shape.
- **Admin config page now exposes 23 previously-hidden keys** (`fun_mode`,
  `persona`, `security.spotlighting.*`, `security.crypto.*`,
  `security.sleuth.*`, `security.lodo.*`). Schema entries grouped by
  dotted prefix so the admin UI can render collapsible sections. New
  `secret: True` schema flag masks values in `GET /api/config`
  responses; applied to `security.sleuth.api_key` and now also
  `worker_llm_api_key`. PUT handlers treat an incoming `"***"` on a
  secret key as a no-op for that key so a whole-config echo from the
  frontend cannot overwrite the real stored secret with the mask.
- **Runtime state file** `~/.local/spellbook/state.json` separated from
  `spellbook.json` to keep user-chosen config distinct from
  daemon-authored runtime state. Currently carries
  `update_check_failures` and `auto_update_branch`. A one-shot migration
  at `session_init` moves any legacy values out of `spellbook.json`.
- **`spellbook.json` dead keys removed**: `tts_enabled`, `tts_volume`,
  `telemetry_enabled`. The TTS subsystem was removed earlier in 0.54.0
  but these keys lingered in the schema; the migration also drops them
  from existing config files on first session_init.
- **Worker-LLM call `status` vocabulary normalized** to
  `{success, error, timeout, fail_open, dropped}` at the client publish
  site. Previously the client emitted raw `"ok"` and exception-class
  names (`"TimeoutError"`, `"ConnectionError"`, ...), which broke the
  admin-UI aggregate metrics, the threshold notifier, and the warm-probe
  "last success" calculation.
- **Background offload for observability writes**: shared
  `_spawn_background` helper in `spellbook/worker_llm/events.py` that
  runs a callable via `loop.run_in_executor` when an event loop is
  active and falls back to a direct sync call otherwise. Applied to
  `record_call` inside `publish_call` (daemon path) and to
  `record_hook_event` inside the `/api/hooks/record` route so the
  daemon event loop is never blocked on SQLite writer-lock contention.
- **Count-cap purge rewrite** in both
  `spellbook/worker_llm/observability.py` and
  `spellbook/hooks/observability.py`: replaces
  `DELETE ... WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id ... LIMIT max_rows)` with an
  inlined scalar subquery `id <= (SELECT id ORDER BY id DESC OFFSET
  max_rows LIMIT 1)`. SQLite's support for LIMIT inside IN/NOT IN
  subqueries is compile-time optional, and the old pattern was O(N*M)
  because the keep-set was re-evaluated per batch. The new shape uses
  `IN` (always supported) against an indexed PK scan and terminates
  naturally when the OFFSET returns NULL.
- **`session_mode` config validation**: `_validate_config_value` now
  rejects values outside `{fun, tarot, none}` so an admin UI typo cannot
  land an invalid persisted mode. Mirrors the existing
  `worker_llm_transcript_harvest_mode` guard.
- **`ConfigField` value resync**: `spellbook/admin/frontend/src/pages/ConfigEditor.tsx`
  now resyncs the local `editValue` state via `useEffect` when the
  `value` prop changes externally (e.g., after a successful save
  refetches config, or when the user cancels an edit). Previously the
  field remained frozen on its first-mount value until the component
  unmounted.

## [0.53.1] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- **Installer dependency resolution**: `uv run install.py` ran the script
  under an isolated PEP 723 env with `dependencies = []`, so `rich`,
  `sqlalchemy`, and other project deps declared in `pyproject.toml` were
  never available at install time. Re-exec commands now use
  `uv run --project <repo> python <script>` to pick up the full project
  environment. Also added a final re-exec step for the curl-pipe path with
  an existing local repo, which previously fell through to `run_installation`
  under plain `python3` and crashed importing `rich`.
- **Daemon `/health` route silently missing**: `spellbook/mcp/routes.py`
  imported `spellbook.notifications.tts` at module scope, which pulled in
  `numpy` (part of the optional `tts` dep group). When TTS wasn't installed,
  the import failed and `register_all_tools()` swallowed the error, so
  `@mcp.custom_route("/health")` was never registered. The installer's
  health check then 404'd and reported daemon startup failure. Moved the
  `tts` import into the `/api/speak` handler so it's only loaded when that
  endpoint is actually called.

## [0.53.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **File-based memory system** (replaces the SQLAlchemy-backed memory):
  frontmatter + body storage, QMD + Serena search backends, confidence and
  `last_verified` fields, access log, citation tracking, sync pipeline,
  secret scanner, migration tooling.
- **Confidence decay** applied lazily in scoring: `high → medium → low`
  multiplier (1.0 / 0.7 / 0.4) based on `last_verified` (or `created`
  fallback). `store_memory()` defaults `confidence="high"`. Sync pipeline
  `STILL_TRUE` verdict refreshes `last_verified`.
- **Automatic memory recall on hooks**: `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse`
  handlers extract keywords / paths, call `/api/memory/recall`, inject
  `<spellbook-memory-context>` into prompts. Budget 500 tokens / 5 memories.
  Atomic dedup log with 15-minute TTL. Config toggle `memory.auto_recall`
  (default true).
- **Automatic memory storage on hooks**: `UserPromptSubmit` pattern detection
  for corrections / confirmations / explicit remember; `Stop` hook harvests
  `<memory-candidate>` self-nominations from the assistant transcript.
  Rule-dictation exception. Partial-failure retry semantics. Config toggle
  `memory.auto_store` (default true). `AGENTS.spellbook.md` documents the
  self-nomination schema.
- **Admin API**: three filestore-backed endpoints — `GET /api/memories`,
  `/search`, `/{path:path}`. Path-traversal guard.

### Changed

- `/api/memory/recall` rewired to `filestore.recall_memories` with
  `cwd`-derived namespace.
- Admin frontend (`types.ts`, `useMemories.ts`, `MemoryBrowser.tsx`) updated
  to new schema (path-as-id, new Citation shape, `confidence`, `last_verified`).

### Removed

- ORM-backed memory endpoints: `/stats`, `/consolidate`, `/namespaces`,
  memory update/delete. No backwards compatibility (pre-1.0).

## [0.52.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Stable source symlink** (`~/.local/spellbook/source`) is now the canonical
  `$SPELLBOOK_DIR` for all installed artifacts. `install.py` creates or
  repoints this symlink on every run; hook commands, launchd plists,
  systemd units, and CLAUDE.md variable blocks reference the symlink
  rather than the resolved checkout path. Switching worktrees is now a
  one-command operation: re-run `install.py` from the new worktree and
  every artifact follows the symlink automatically.
- **Backup-then-symlink** when the target path exists as a real directory.
  With `--yes`, the existing directory is renamed to
  `source.backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` and replaced with the symlink. Without
  `--yes`, the installer aborts with an actionable error.
- **`spellbook_managed: true` + `spellbook_hook_id`** fields on every
  installer-written hook entry in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Re-installs
  dedup by these fields instead of matching paths, so re-installing from
  a different worktree replaces the old entries cleanly instead of
  appending duplicates.

### Changed

- **Daemon-venv editable install** is now refreshed when the source path
  changes (new `.source-path` marker), not just when `pyproject.toml`
  changes. Refresh runs `pip uninstall spellbook -y` twice (defensive,
  handles stale non-editable installs) before `pip install --no-deps -e`
  against the symlink path.

### Fixed

- Re-running `install.py` from a different worktree no longer leaves the
  `~/.claude/settings.json` hook array with duplicate
  `spellbook_hook.py` entries (one per worktree).
- Launchd plist `WorkingDirectory` and `SPELLBOOK_DIR` env now reference
  the stable symlink, so the daemon survives worktree moves without
  breaking.

## [0.51.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **cco sandbox launcher**: `scripts/spellbook-sandbox` wraps [nikvdp/cco](https://github.com/nikvdp/cco) so Claude Code / OpenCode / Codex can run under YOLO mode with automatic sandboxing. The source tree is mounted read-only; the config directory is mounted read-only since hook subprocesses route writes (error logs, messaging state) through the daemon's HTTP API.
- **Sandboxing documentation**: New `## Sandboxing with cco (macOS)` section in `docs/security.md` covering quick-start, `--safe` mode, and threat model.
- **Installer post-install hint**: `render_post_install_notes()` surfaces an optional hint when `cco` is detected on `PATH`, pointing to the launcher and docs.

## [0.50.0] - 2026-04-08

### Removed

**Nuclear security cleanup**: a large pile of markdown-theater "security" features
that were never invoked, broken, or created false confidence has been deleted.
Pre-1.0 breaking change. Surviving gates: the Bash `PreToolUse` pattern check, the
spawn-session pattern check plus rate limit, the `workflow_state_save/load`
validator, and the pre-commit scanner.

- **PromptSleuth** semantic intent classification (source, tests, MCP tools,
  config keys, installer entries, DB tables `intent_checks`, `sleuth_budget`,
  `sleuth_cache`). Never reached production; depended on an uninstalled SDK path.
- **Ed25519 cryptographic provenance**: signing, verification, key generation,
  installer bootstrap, `installer/components/keys.py`, and the hook-level
  crypto gate. The gate silently blocked every call because content was never
  actually signed end-to-end. `cryptography` dropped from dependencies.
- **Canary tokens** (MCP tools, hook post-tool scanning, `canary_tokens` table,
  health check).
- **Session content accumulator** for "split injection" detection
  (`session_content_accumulator` table, MCP tools, hook writer).
- **Trust registry** (MCP tools, `trust_registry` table, hostile-marking path in
  workflow state validation, skill-level trust tier system).
- **Security event logging + dashboard + query CLI** (`security_events` table,
  `security_log_event`/`security_query_events`/`security_dashboard` MCP tools,
  `spellbook security events` CLI subcommand, admin `/api/security` routes,
  admin `/api/analytics` routes, admin dashboard security counts).
- **Spotlighting** (delimiter-based external content wrapping, hook integration,
  PR fetch wrapper, config keys).
- **Security modes** (`security_mode` table, `security_set_mode` MCP tool,
  `get_current_mode`/`should_auto_elevate` helpers, `--mode` CLI flags).
- **Input/output sanitization MCP surface** (`security_check_output`,
  `security_sanitize_input`, `do_sanitize_input`, `do_check_output`).
- **Honeypot MCP decoy tools** (`security_disable_all_checks`,
  `system_prompt_dump`, `credential_export`) — depended on deleted event logging.
- **LODO evaluation harness** (`scripts/run_lodo_eval.py`, datasets).
- **`security-trust-tiers` skill** plus all references in `AGENTS.spellbook.md`,
  README, docs, and `dispatching-parallel-agents`.
- **Installer security wizard** / `--security-level` / `--security-wizard` flags /
  `installer/components/security.py` / feature group UI.
- **`check_security_domain` health probe** (dropped from `FULL_DOMAINS`).
- Legacy `TRUST_LEVELS`, `INJECTION_TRIGGERS`, `EXFILTRATION_PATTERNS` exports.

### Changed

- **`spellbook/security/` renamed to `spellbook/gates/`** to reflect its new
  reality as pattern-based gates, not a security framework. All imports updated.
  The scanner, rules, check module, and the trimmed `do_detect_injection`
  helper move with it. `python3 -m spellbook.gates.check` is the CLI entry
  point used by the OpenCode plugin.
- **`security_check_tool_input`** is now the only remaining `security_*` MCP
  tool. It wraps the same `check_tool_input` used by the hooks.
- **`init_db`** drops the deleted tables if they exist (cleanup path for
  upgraded installs); no new CREATE TABLE statements for deleted features.
- **Surviving gates run unconditionally.** No more `security.mode`,
  `security.enabled`, `security.spotlighting.*`, `security.crypto.*`,
  `security.sleuth.*`, or `security.lodo.*` config keys.

## [0.49.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- **Platform self-identification**: `spellbook_session_init` now accepts a `platform` parameter so LLMs can self-identify their platform (`claude_code`, `opencode`, `codex`, `gemini`) from their own system prompt instead of relying on environment variable detection. `AGENTS.spellbook.md` Step 0 no longer runs `env | grep` at session start.

## [0.48.0] - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- Replace `anti-ai-tone.md` with comprehensive `writing-guide.md` covering structural dead tells, human signals, sniff test, and before/after examples
- Update all references across commands, docs, and skills

## [0.47.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **TTS service management**: Managed TTS service via launchd (macOS), systemd (Linux), and Task Scheduler (Windows)
- **ServiceConfig dataclass**: Parameterized service management replacing hardcoded MCP-only ServiceManager
- **Dedicated TTS venv**: Isolated virtual environment with auto-device detection (mps/cuda/cpu)
- **Lazy TTS provisioning**: `config_set` MCP tool triggers async fire-and-forget TTS provisioning
- **Eager TTS provisioning**: Installer wizard provisions TTS service during setup
- **TTS service cleanup**: Uninstaller removes TTS service, venv, and related artifacts
- **Cross-process provisioning lock**: File-based lock prevents concurrent TTS provisioning
- **`--security-wizard` flag**: Opt-in flag for `install.py` to run the interactive security feature selection wizard

### Changed
- **ServiceManager refactored**: Accepts `ServiceConfig` instead of hardcoded MCP service assumptions
- **WYOMING_DEFAULT_HOST**: Changed from `"localhost"` to `"127.0.0.1"` for IPv4 consistency
- **Installer tagline**: Updated from "Defense-in-depth security for AI coding assistants" to "Skills, commands, and MCP tools for AI coding assistants"
- **Security prompts default to silent**: The installer no longer prompts for security feature configuration during install. Recommended defaults (spotlighting=on, crypto=on, sleuth=off, lodo=on) are applied silently. Use `--security-wizard` to opt into the interactive quiz, or change settings post-install via `spellbook config set` or the admin UI.

## [0.46.2] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Installer update prompt from source repo**: Running `./install.py` from within the git repo no longer prompts "Update to latest version?" against origin/main. The installer now detects when it is being run from the source repository and skips the update check.

## [0.46.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Security hook false positives**: LOW-severity entropy findings (ENTROPY-001) no longer block legitimate Bash commands. The entropy check is retained as an informational signal but no longer causes `check_tool_input` or `check_tool_output` to return `safe=False`.

## [0.46.0] - 2026-04-06

### Breaking
- **TTS MCP tools renamed**: `kokoro_speak` and `kokoro_status` renamed to `tts_speak` and `tts_status`
- **TTS backend replaced**: TTS no longer uses in-process Kokoro. Requires a Wyoming protocol TTS server (e.g., wyoming-piper, wyoming-kokoro)

### Changed
- **TTS dependency group**: Now includes `wyoming`, `numpy`, `sounddevice` (removed `kokoro`, `soundfile`, `spacy`, `misaki`)
- **`TTS_DEFAULT_VOICE`**: Changed from `af_heart` to empty string (uses server default)
- **Admin frontend**: Upgraded React to v19, added `@testing-library/dom`, reverted tailwindcss v4 (requires CSS migration)
- **Brainstorming skill**: Renamed to `design-exploration`

### Added
- **Wyoming TTS config keys**: `tts_wyoming_host` and `tts_wyoming_port` for connecting to Wyoming protocol TTS servers
- **Hook config override**: `SPELLBOOK_CONFIG_PATH` env var for overriding hook config file path

### Fixed
- **Admin frontend build**: Fixed TypeScript errors from React 18/19 version mismatch and missing `@testing-library/dom` peer dep
- **Content provenance tests**: Tests no longer fail when user machine has crypto verification enabled
- **Welcome action**: Bot PRs/issues no longer trigger the first-time contributor welcome message
- **Feature-research diagram**: Improved with subgraphs, cross-references, and completion checklist

### Dependencies
- Bumped `@opencode-ai/sdk` to 1.3.13 (context-curator, workflow-state)
- Bumped `@opencode-ai/plugin` to 1.3.13 (context-curator, workflow-state)
- Bumped `typescript` to 6.0.2 (context-curator, workflow-state, spellbook-forged)
- Bumped `vitest` to 4.1.2 (tests/unit), 4.1.1 (admin frontend)
- Bumped `typescript-eslint` to 8.57.2 (admin frontend)
- Bumped `vite` to 8.0.2 (admin frontend)
- Bumped `@eslint/js` to 10.0.1 (admin frontend)

## [0.45.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Session-scoped stint support**: Stints now track behavioral mode (agent type) per session, enabling mode-aware focus context across OpenCode agent types
- **OpenCode workflow-state extension improvements**: Enhanced workflow state handling for OpenCode platform integration
- **OpencodeAgentClient test coverage**: New tests for the OpenCode agent client
- **Expanded stint test coverage**: Additional tests for stint push, pop, replace, and session-scoped behavior

### Fixed
- **OpenCode security plugin**: Removed dead `SPELLBOOK_DIR` guard that blocked the security plugin from loading when the environment variable was unset

## [0.44.0] - 2026-04-04

### Removed
- Crush platform support. Spellbook no longer installs or configures Crush (`installer/platforms/crush.py` deleted). Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and Gemini CLI remain supported.

## [0.43.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **PromptSleuth installer description**: Changed "Requires an Anthropic API key" to "Requires an LLM provider (Claude Code or Gemini CLI)" since sleuth uses the unified SDK, not a direct API key
- **Dead config key**: Removed vestigial `security.sleuth.api_key` config key and default that nothing read

## [0.43.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **`pr-dance` command**: New command that loops a PR through iterative CI + bot review cycles until merge-ready. Bot-agnostic with user-configurable review bot preferences stored in CLAUDE.md (project or global level)
- **"Create PR + PR dance" integration option**: Option 3 in `finishing-a-development-branch` skill creates a PR and immediately starts the PR dance loop via subagent

### Changed
- **`finishing-a-development-branch`**: Expanded from 4 to 5 options (new option 3 for PR + dance, renumbered keep/discard to 4/5)
- **`finish-branch-execute`**: Added Option 3 handler that dispatches `pr-dance` subagent after PR creation

### Fixed
- **Unified SDK wrapper**: `ClaudeAgentClient` now properly extracts `TextBlock.text` from `AssistantMessage.content` instead of storing raw content block objects. Added `on_text` streaming callback and `timeout` (default 120s) to `AgentOptions`. CLI stderr is now piped through a visible callback instead of being swallowed.
- **Diagram generation script**: Classification and patching use the fixed SDK wrapper with `on_text` streaming so AI output is visible during `generate_diagrams.py --interactive`

## [0.42.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Messaging auto-registration**: Sessions are automatically registered for cross-session messaging during `spellbook_session_init` with human-readable aliases derived from git branch/worktree context
- **Alias derivation**: Resolution order: explicit `session_name` param > git branch/worktree name (slugified, project-prefixed) > project directory basename > "session" fallback
- **Atomic collision handling**: `MessageBus.register_with_suffix()` handles alias collisions with numeric suffixes under a single lock acquisition, with session-aware compaction detection
- **Git context detection**: `detect_git_context()` utility detects branch name, worktree status, and handles detached HEAD with short commit hash fallback
- **`continuation_message` parameter**: Now wired through the `spellbook_session_init` MCP tool to the core `session_init()` function
- **Upfront installer wizard**: All configuration questions (platforms, security, TTS, profile) are now collected in a single wizard before installation begins, replacing the previous scattered prompts
- **Rich-based platform selector**: Platform selection now uses Rich panels and prompts instead of raw termios, improving Windows compatibility and visual consistency
- **Startup profiling**: Daemon startup phases are now individually timed and logged for performance visibility

### Fixed
- **Config wizard filtering bug**: `--reconfigure` security feature prompts now correctly match dotted config keys to bare feature IDs (previously always returned empty)

### Removed
- **init_curator_tables no-op**: Removed dead code from daemon startup (function was already a pass-through)

## [0.41.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- **Cross-session messaging**: In-memory message bus with bounded queues, direct/broadcast/reply patterns, correlation tracking with TTL sweep, and SSE real-time delivery via MessageBridge
- **Messaging MCP tools**: `messaging_register`, `messaging_send`, `messaging_broadcast`, `messaging_reply`, `messaging_poll`, `messaging_list`, `messaging_unregister` for inter-session communication
- **File-based bridge**: MessageBridge writes messages to per-alias inbox directories and polls SSE streams for delivery, enabling hook-based message injection without daemon coupling
- **Session-scoped inbox draining**: Hook `_messaging_check` only drains inboxes matching the current session ID via `.session_id` marker files

## [0.40.0] - 2026-04-04

### Removed
- **Swarm coordination subsystem**: Removed all swarm MCP tools (`mcp_swarm_create`, `mcp_swarm_register`, `mcp_swarm_progress`, `mcp_swarm_complete`, `mcp_swarm_error`, `mcp_swarm_monitor`), coordination server, protocol schemas, backend abstraction, worker contract, state manager, retry policy, and DB models
- **Session spawner**: Removed unused `spellbook/session/` package
- **Coordination backend preferences**: Removed `CoordinationBackend`, `CoordinationConfig`, and related preference types from `core/preferences.py`
- **Dashboard swarm metrics**: Removed `running_swarms` count from admin dashboard

## [0.39.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Session profiles**: 8 bundled behavioral profiles (Thought Partner, Terse, Mentor, Critic, Rubber Duck, Ship It, Architect, Quiet) that shape AI assistant tone and collaboration style per session
- **Profile selection wizard**: Installer and `--reconfigure` offer profile selection during setup; selected profile injected into sessions via `session_init`
- **Profile auto-discovery**: Profiles from `profiles/` directory with custom overrides from `~/.local/spellbook/profiles/`
- **Headless session spawning**: `spawn_session` defaults to subprocess mode (`claude -p`) instead of opening a terminal window; supports `allowed_tools` and `disallowed_tools` for tool restriction
- **Hook error logging**: Errors in `spellbook_hook.py` logged to `~/.local/spellbook/logs/hook-errors.log` with 1MB rotation and 3 backups

### Changed
- **Hooks use daemon venv Python**: Hook commands now invoke the daemon venv interpreter instead of system Python, ensuring all spellbook dependencies are available
- **Security gates fail-closed**: Hook security gates exit with code 2 when the security module is unavailable, with diagnostic logging
- **Fractal error messages**: Validation errors for `intensity` and `checkpoint_mode` now list valid options
- **Skill documentation**: Added valid parameter values for fractal intensity/checkpoint_mode and roundtable stage/archetypes to skill and command descriptions

### Fixed
- **Installer daemon progress**: Moved progress display initialization before daemon install so "Starting daemon..." appears during the venv build and health-check loop instead of a blank pause
- **Reconfigure config persistence**: `--reconfigure` in both `install.py` and CLI now correctly persists config wizard selections (previously discarded)
- **Security module imports**: Moved DB-dependent imports in `security/check.py` from module level into functions to avoid requiring `aiosqlite` at import time
- **bigfoot 0.19.1 compatibility**: Migrated ~20 test files from bigfoot sandboxes to monkeypatch for subprocess/socket/database interception compatibility

## [0.38.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **`documenting-projects` skill**: Publication-ready documentation generation with Diataxis framework enforcement and adaptive tone profiles
- **5 new commands**: `/docs-audit`, `/docs-plan`, `/docs-write`, `/docs-review`, `/write-readme` for structured documentation workflows
- **Anti-AI-tone rules**: 23+ banned phrases enforced across all documentation output
- **Build tooling auto-detection**: Automatic discovery of MkDocs, Sphinx, and Docusaurus configurations
- **8 measurable quality criteria** for documentation review scoring
- **Standalone `/write-readme` command** for lightweight README generation without full docs workflow

## [0.37.1] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **Testing framework**: Migrated entire test suite (99 files, 4822 tests) from `unittest.mock` to bigfoot
  - Strict sandbox enforcement: every external call must be pre-authorized
  - Every mock interaction must be asserted (catches unused mocks)
  - Guard mode prevents real I/O by default (subprocess, HTTP, database blocked unless explicitly allowed)
- Added `dirty-equals` to dev dependencies for flexible assertion matching

## [0.37.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Installer renderer abstraction** (`installer/renderer.py`): `InstallerRenderer` ABC with `RichRenderer` (wraps existing TUI) and `PlainTextRenderer` (no Rich dependency) implementations, enabling non-TTY and CI environments
- **Installer CLI flags**: `--security-level {minimal,standard,strict}`, `--no-tts`, and `--reconfigure` for non-interactive and upgrade workflows
- **Config introspection helpers** (`spellbook/core/config.py`): `config_is_explicitly_set()` and `get_unset_config_keys()` for flat dotted-key config lookup
- **Unified Agent SDK** (`spellbook/sdk/unified.py`): Single programmatic interface for Claude and Gemini agents, built on `claude-agent-sdk`
- **Tooling discovery registry** (`spellbook/tooling/index_registry.py`): Indexed MCP tool registry for faster lookups
- **Multi-provider diagram generation**: `generate_diagrams.py` updated to produce architecture diagrams for all supported platforms
- **Installer renderer and config helper tests**: 24 new tests across `test_installer_renderer.py` and `test_installer_config_helpers.py`
- **Unified SDK tests**: Unit tests in `tests/unit/test_unified_sdk.py`

### Changed
- **Installer entry points wired through renderer**: Both `install.py` and `spellbook/cli/commands/install.py` now create a renderer (auto-detecting TTY) and pass it to `Installer.run()` instead of calling `tui.py` directly
- **Platform support documentation**: Claude Code marked as primary platform; OpenCode, Codex, Gemini CLI, Crush marked as basic support across README, AGENTS.md, and platform docs
- **Skill documentation optimized**: Reduced token usage in dehallucination, writing-skills, and using-skills skill docs
- **Tooling discovery refactored**: Enhanced `spellbook/tooling/discovery.py` with registry-backed lookups

### Fixed
- **AsyncMock test failures**: 4 tests in `test_diagram_update.py` used `MagicMock` for async `generate_diagram()`, causing `TypeError` on `await`

## [0.36.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Runtime injection defense**: 5 concentric defense layers for external content: spotlighting boundary marking, session content accumulator, LODO-evaluated regex detection, PromptSleuth semantic intent classification, and Ed25519 cryptographic content provenance
- **Rich TUI installer** (`installer/tui.py`): Interactive terminal UI with platform selection checkboxes, security feature configuration, and key generation progress display
- **6 new MCP security tools**: `security_check_intent`, `security_sign_content`, `security_verify_signature`, `security_accumulator_write`, `security_accumulator_status`, `security_sleuth_reset_budget`
- **4 new database tables**: `intent_checks`, `session_content_accumulator`, `sleuth_budget`, `sleuth_cache`
- **LODO evaluation framework**: Leave-One-Dataset-Out testing for regex detectors with 4 curated attack datasets (AdvBench, BIPIA, HarmBench, InjecAgent)
- **Ed25519 key management**: Key generation, rotation with archive support, auto-signing of trusted files during installation
- **Spotlighting integration**: PostToolUse hook auto-wraps external content; `pr_fetch` wraps PR diffs
- **Content accumulator hook**: PostToolUse auto-records external content fragments for split injection detection
- **`cryptography` and `rich` dependencies** for crypto provenance and TUI

### Fixed
- **WebSearch missing from security_tools set**: PostToolUse security scanning now covers WebSearch results

### Changed
- **Crypto provenance defaults to opt-in**: Disabled by default, enabled by the TUI installer after successful key generation

## [0.35.2] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- **Security page severity counts**: Summary cards showed 0 for Critical/Warning/Info due to case mismatch (backend returns uppercase, frontend looked up lowercase)

## [0.35.1] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
- **Stint system redesign**: Stints are now LLM-owned attention declarations, not auto-generated tool call traces
- **Simplified stint entry schema**: Removed `type`, `parent`, `exited_at`, `success_criteria` fields from new entries
- **Admin stacks page**: Removed type badge and type column; depth gauge max changed from 8 to 6

### Added
- **Depth cap**: Hard limit of 6 on stint stack depth in `push_stint`
- **Empty-stack nudge**: Depth check now returns a nudge when no focus is declared
- **Staleness warnings**: Entries older than 4 hours are flagged in depth check output
- **Focus Tracking guidance** in `AGENTS.spellbook.md` explaining stint ownership model
- **One-time cleanup script** (`scripts/reset_bloated_stints.py`) for resetting bloated stacks

### Removed
- **`_stint_auto_push` hook**: No longer auto-pushes stints on Skill tool invocations (root cause of unbounded stack growth)
- **`success_criteria` parameter** from `stint_push` MCP tool

## [0.35.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Auto-memory bridge hook**: Intercepts Claude Code Write tool calls to `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/` paths and mirrors content into spellbook's structured memory via new `/api/memory/bridge-content` endpoint
- **Bridge content endpoint** (`/api/memory/bridge-content`): Dual-event storage with brief summary for consolidation pipeline + full content for audit trail
- **MEMORY.md bootstrap regenerator** (`spellbook/memory/bootstrap.py`): Generates static redirect template instructing the model to use spellbook MCP memory tools
- **Session init memory integration**: Refreshes MEMORY.md on every new session start via `spellbook_session_init`
- **Memory System section** in `AGENTS.spellbook.md` supplementing Claude Code auto-memory with spellbook MCP tool preferences
- **ErrorBoundary** component wrapping all admin page routes to catch render crashes with error display and retry
- **ErrorDisplay** component for admin data fetch failures with retry button
- **`--stamp` flag** for `generate_diagrams.py` to skip diagram generation and just update hashes
- **Worktree Dispatch Preamble** in dispatching-parallel-agents skill enforcing 5-step verification for subagent worktree work

### Fixed
- **Stacks page blank render**: Hook extracted `.stacks` instead of `.items` from API response
- **Config nav position**: Moved to second item (right after Dashboard)
- **Corrections header height**: Filter buttons moved from header to content area for consistent header sizing across pages
- **Worktree dispatch instructions**: Subagent prompts now require explicit path/branch verification before any work

## [0.34.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Fractal explorer redesign**: two-view layout with full-width data table (list view) and dedicated details pane (graph view)
- **GraphTable component**: sortable columns (seed, status, intensity, nodes, project dir, created, updated), text search, status filter, project dir filter, pagination
- **Breadcrumb navigation**: `// FRACTAL // Graph "seed..." // Node #id // Chat Log` with clickable segments
- **`project_dir` column** on fractal graphs table (v3-to-v4 schema migration), exposed in list API with filtering support
- **Fractal list API enhancements**: `search`, `sort_by`, `sort_order`, `project_dir` query params; `updated_at` in response
- **PageHeader and PageLayout components**: shared layout primitives for consistent headers across all admin pages
- **Dashboard improvements**: per-database health indicators, top 5 tools with analytics summary, session count from actual conversation files

### Changed
- All 12 admin pages migrated to shared PageLayout component for consistent `// PAGE_NAME` headers and spacing
- Dashboard session count now scans `~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl` files instead of querying transient `souls` table
- Dashboard Event Bus section collapsed to single compact row
- Analytics page period selector styled as inline text toggles

### Fixed
- Dashboard showing 0 sessions (was querying wrong data source)

## [0.33.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Develop skill execution model redesign**: dialectic validation (none/roundtable) and token enforcement (work-item/gate/every-step) are now independent user preferences, configurable in Phase 0.4
- **Scope drift detection**: re-evaluation checkpoints in Phase 1.5 discovery catch when user answers expand scope beyond the classified complexity tier. New `SCOPE_EXPANSION` ARH response type, `evaluate_scope_drift()` detection function, and 12th completeness validation function (`scope_consistent_with_tier`)
- **Dispatch enforcement**: CRITICAL blocks and post-gate verification on all 8 Phase 4 subagent dispatch points. Three new anti-rationalization patterns: Gate Elision, Self-Review Substitution, Momentum Preservation
- **Roundtable 3-archetype fast mode**: `GATE_ARCHETYPES` constant maps each quality gate to a 3-archetype subset (Justice always included as arbiter). `get_gate_archetypes()` function for quality gate validation
- **Gate completion tracking**: `gate_completions` table in forged.db, `forge_record_gate_completion` MCP tool, auto-recording on roundtable consensus
- **Dependency enforcement**: `forge_iteration_start` checks project graph for incomplete `depends_on` features before issuing tokens, returns per-dependency status on block
- **Required `gate` and `feature_name` parameters** on `roundtable_convene` and `process_roundtable_response` for explicit gate identification
- `spellbook` CLI with 10 command groups: doctor, server, install, update, admin, config, memory, session, security, events
- Three-layer package architecture: core -> domains -> interfaces
- `websockets` dependency for CLI streaming
- `spellbook/mcp/__main__.py` entry point for `python -m spellbook.mcp` daemon execution

### Changed
- **Work decomposition is now transparent**: orchestrator decides based on plan structure and context budget, replacing the rigid COMPLEX/swarmed execution model. Work-item prompt files replace work packets
- Package renamed from `spellbook_mcp` to `spellbook`
- server.py (3,945 lines) decomposed into mcp/server.py + 13 tool files + routes
- Daemon installer calls `install_service()` directly instead of spawning `scripts/spellbook-server.py` subprocess
- Diagram freshness checking hashes heading structure instead of full content (ignores frontmatter changes), pre-commit hook scoped to staged files only
- All roundtable callers updated for required `gate` parameter, including OpenCode extension (pre-existing broken caller fixed)

### Deprecated
- `autonomous-roundtable` skill (absorbed into develop; migration guide provided)
- "Forge" as a user-facing workflow concept (forge_* MCP tool namespace preserved for backward compatibility)
- `spellbook_mcp` package name (backward compat shim provided, will be removed next release)
- `SPELLBOOK_MCP_*` environment variables (use `SPELLBOOK_*` instead)

### Removed
- `scripts/spellbook-server.py` deprecated wrapper (daemon management via `spellbook server <command>` or direct `install_service()` call)
- Swarmed execution mode and work packet generation (replaced by work-item prompt files)
- Token estimation math in Phase 3.4.5 (replaced by plan-structure-based decomposition)

### Fixed
- Installer crash when `spellbook` package not yet pip-installed (handle missing metadata in `__init__.py`)
- Daemon not starting after package reorg (missing `__main__.py`, wrong module path in launchd/systemd service files)
- Daemon installer output leaking raw `print()` into formatted installer output
- `spellbook doctor` test monkeypatching wrong module (command module vs source module)
- Windows test failures: `HOME` vs `USERPROFILE`, hardcoded Unix paths, hardcoded `/tmp`

## [0.32.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- **README rewrite**: Fact-checked all claims, fixed skill count (55->56), command count (90->91), tarot archetype count (four->ten). Removed nonexistent `[admin]` pip extra and `spellbook admin open` CLI command. Rewrote tone from marketing-speak to relaxed and explanatory.
- **Citation corrections**: Fixed ICML 2025 paper attribution from "Raghunathan" to "Nagarajan et al." with correct title "Roll the dice & look before you leap" across README, AGENTS.spellbook.md, citations.md, fun-mode skill, and generated docs. Fixed Zheng caveat from "objective/STEM tasks" to "factual question-answering".
- **CVE descriptions**: All 4 CVEs in SECURITY.md and docs/security.md were mischaracterized. Corrected: CVE-2025-53967 (command injection in Figma MCP), CVE-2025-66414 (DNS rebinding in TS SDK), CVE-2025-66416 (DNS rebinding in Python SDK), CVE-2025-59536 (code injection in Claude Code startup).
- **Dead links**: Removed Trail of Bits and Embrace The Red blog URLs (404s) from docs/security.md source citations.
- **CHANGELOG corrections**: Fixed references to nonexistent `spellbook admin open` and `[admin]` extra in 0.32.0 entry. Fixed tarot "four core personas" to "ten archetypes".
- **THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES**: Reconciled with README acknowledgments table. Added derived commands (verify, systematic-debugging), noted executing-plans incorporates subagent-driven-development content.
- **Platform docs**: Replaced vague Gemini CLI limitations with specific details (no Task tool, native skills pending upstream). Added Crush to installation platform detection table and --platforms option.
- **Porting guide**: Removed emotional manipulation language ("important to my career", "take a deep breath", "believe in your abilities") while preserving all technical content.
- **AGENTS.spellbook.md**: Selective trim of most performative language ("viscerally uncomfortable", "debate fiercely", "zen master") while keeping behavioral rules.
- **Architecture docs**: Updated MCP server tool listing from outdated 5-tool list to accurate 15-category overview of 100+ tools. Fixed swarm tool names.
- **Contributing docs**: Aligned test commands with actual convention (`uv run pytest tests/` not split unit/integration).

## [0.32.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Zeigarnik focus-tracking system** - Stint stack tracks nested units of work with entry context, reminds the LLM to stay on task via depth-triggered heuristics (configurable threshold, default 5), and lets the LLM correct tracked state. Four MCP tools: `stint_push`, `stint_pop`, `stint_check`, `stint_replace`. Correction events logged for analytics (MCP-wrong vs LLM-wrong classification).
- **Unified Python hook** - Single `spellbook_hook.py` replaces all 12 individual shell hooks, reducing per-tool-call process spawns from up to 7 to 1. Security gates (bash-gate, spawn-guard, canary-check, state-sanitize) remain fail-closed; all other handlers (memory, TTS, notifications, audit) are fail-open. Windows parity via `spellbook_hook.ps1` wrapper.
- **Stint auto-push for skills** - PreToolUse hook automatically pushes a stint when a Skill tool is invoked, tracking skill invocations without requiring explicit LLM cooperation.
- **Stint compaction survival** - Pre-compact hook saves stint stack to workflow state; post-compact hook restores it via `stint_replace`, preserving focus context across context resets.
- **Behavioral mode preservation** - Stint entries carry a `behavioral_mode` field (e.g., "ORCHESTRATOR: delegate via subagents") that survives compaction and gets re-injected via depth check reminders and post-compact recovery. Auto-populated from `<BEHAVIORAL_MODE>` tags in SKILL.md files.
- **Smart diagram updates** - `generate_diagrams.py` now classifies source changes before deciding how to update diagrams: non-structural changes are stamped fresh without regeneration, small structural changes trigger surgical patching, and only major restructures trigger full regeneration. Uses haiku model for fast classification. Interactive mode shows classification with Enter-to-accept defaults.

### Fixed
- **Recovery directive skill constraint fetch** - `_build_recovery_directive` used wrong dict keys (`found`/`constraints` instead of `success`/`content`) when fetching skill constraints, so FORBIDDEN/REQUIRED sections were never included in post-compaction recovery.

### Changed
- **Hook installer upgrade path** - Installing spellbook now removes old individual shell hook entries from `settings.json` and registers the unified hook. User-defined hooks are preserved.
- **Renamed `implementing-features` skill to `develop`** - Shorter, more descriptive name. Applied via `scripts/rename_skills.py` across 100 files (skills, commands, docs, diagrams, tests, Python backend). Old name no longer exists; all references updated.
- **Removed `receiving-code-review` skill** - Deprecated skill removed along with all references. Functionality consolidated into code-review `--feedback` mode.

### Added
- **Web admin interface** - Browser-based admin UI served from the MCP daemon at `/admin`. Provides real-time observability and management across all spellbook subsystems.
  - **Dashboard** with health status, subsystem metrics, and live activity feed
  - **Memory browser** with full-text search, CRUD operations, and consolidation trigger
  - **Security event log** with severity/type/date filtering and summary aggregation
  - **Session viewer** scanning Claude Code JSONL session files with project filtering and expandable detail
  - **Config editor** with toggle switches for boolean settings, inline editing, and default value rendering
  - **Fractal graph explorer** with interactive Cytoscape.js visualization, depth filtering, node detail panels, chat log viewer, and viewport persistence in URL params
  - **Tool call analytics** dashboard mining security_events for tool frequency, error rates, and usage timeline with period filtering
  - **Subsystem health matrix** showing vital signs across all 4 SQLite databases with status badges, row counts, and last activity
  - **Event bus live monitor** with real-time WebSocket event stream, subsystem filtering, auto-scroll, and event detail expansion
  - **WebSocket event streaming** with ticket-based auth, auto-reconnect, and shared connection via React Context
  - **Asyncio event bus** with bounded per-subscriber queues and thread-safe `publish_sync()` for MCP handlers
  - **Pull-based MCP notification queue** with broadcast/namespace/session scoping
  - Admin dashboard accessible at `http://localhost:8765/admin/` when MCP server is running
  - Auth: SHA-256 signed HTTP-only cookies, WebSocket ticket exchange, token-based session management
  - Tech: FastAPI sub-app mounted via `_additional_http_routes`, React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 5 + Tailwind 3
  - Admin frontend bundled with MCP server
  - **Focus tracking admin page** showing per-project stint stacks with depth gauge, correction event log with filtering, and dashboard summary card
  - **Session detail view** with full metadata display (ID, project, slug, title, timestamps, message count, size, first user message) and paginated **chat history viewer** rendering 10+ JSONL message types with type-based visual styling. Both pages separately linkable via `/sessions/:project/:id` and `/sessions/:project/:id/chat`
  - **Session multi-select filter** with checkbox dropdown for filtering by multiple projects simultaneously, plus free-text search across session content
  - **Spellbook branding** throughout admin: book-with-sparkle favicon, sidebar icon, sparkle loading spinner, login page icon
  - **Admin documentation** with screenshots of all 11 pages, added to mkdocs site and README
  - **`[docs]` optional extra** with mkdocs-material, mike for building documentation locally
  - **Version display** in sidebar footer showing running spellbook version
  - **Event monitor with history** - REST endpoint for recent events plus live WebSocket stream; event publishing from security, memory, stint, and fractal MCP handlers
  - **Login page** with MCP token authentication and SHA-256 signed HTTP-only session cookies
  - **Platform compatibility docs** noting Claude Code JSONL session dependency, welcoming contributions for other platforms
  - **`--no-admin` installer flag** to skip admin frontend dependencies; frontend build staleness check via pre-commit hook
- **"Signature Spells" in README and docs** - Five highlighted skills (develop, fractal-thinking, auditing-green-mirage, fact-checking, advanced-code-review) featured as signature capabilities
- **Docs restructuring** - New task-oriented Guide section with curated skill selections, flattened reference navigation, intro paragraphs on guide-listed skill docs pages
- **Quickstart rewrite** - Leads with `develop` skill workflow, links skill names to docs pages, removes outdated design-explore/plan/execute sequence
- **Installer WHAT'S NEW display** - Shows changelog entries for new versions during upgrade
- **Fractal session backfill script** (`scripts/backfill_fractal_sessions.py`) - Populates `session_id` and `timestamp` on existing fractal graph nodes by scanning JSONL session transcripts
- **Shared diagram config** (`scripts/diagram_config.py`) - Centralized exclusion lists, aliases, and tiering config for diagram generation, freshness checking, and docs completeness
- **Bulk skill rename script** (`scripts/rename_skills.py`) - Automates full-codebase skill renames with regex word-boundary protection, specificity ordering, dry-run mode, and `git mv` integration
- **Diagram stamp mode** - `check_diagram_freshness.py --stamp` updates source hashes in diagram metadata without regenerating content

### Fixed
- **Compaction detector missed all compaction events** - `check_for_compaction()` checked `msg.get('type') == 'summary'` but Claude Code marks compaction with `isCompactSummary: true` on `type: "user"` messages. 47 compacted sessions across projects were going undetected, leaving the souls table empty.
- **Broken test import in test_check_tool_input_mcp.py** - `from conftest import get_tool_fn` failed with `ModuleNotFoundError` because pytest conftest modules aren't directly importable from subdirectories. Added `tests/` to `sys.path` so the import resolves correctly.

## [0.30.5] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **MCP auth: hooks sent unauthenticated requests** - All hooks that call the MCP daemon's REST API (`memory-capture`, `memory-inject`, `tts-notify`, `pre-compact-save`, `post-compact-recover`) were missing the `Authorization: Bearer` header, causing 401 Unauthorized on every request. Both bash and PowerShell variants now read the token from `~/.local/spellbook/.mcp-token`.
- **MCP auth: token regenerated on every daemon restart** - `generate_and_store_token()` generated a fresh random token on each startup, invalidating any previously registered auth headers in Claude Code configs. Now reuses the existing token from disk if present, only generating on first install.
- **MCP registration: auth header missing from `.claude.json`** - The spellbook MCP entry in `.claude.json` had no `headers` field, so Claude Code sent unauthenticated requests to the daemon. The installer now passes `--header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"` during registration.
- **MCP registration: non-default config dirs ignored** - `register_mcp_http_server()` always targeted the default `~/.claude` config. Added `config_dir` parameter so the installer correctly registers for each target config directory (e.g., `~/.claude-work`).
- **Docker test collection error** - `tests/docker/test_bootstrap.py` failed to collect due to missing `tests/__init__.py` needed for the `from tests.docker.conftest import ...` import.

## [0.30.4] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- **Removed outdated platform support tables** from README and docs index.

## [0.30.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **MCP registration arg ordering** - `claude mcp add`'s `--header` option is variadic and was consuming positional arguments (`name`, `url`) when placed before them, causing "missing required argument 'name'" errors. Moved `--header` after positional args to match CLI's documented usage. Also added `-s user` scope to `claude mcp remove` calls so they correctly target user-scoped registrations.

## [0.30.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **MCP auth header missing from installer** - The MCP server requires bearer token authentication, but `register_mcp_http_server` and all platform installers omitted the `Authorization` header when registering the server. Clients received 401 Unauthorized on every request. All platforms (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Crush) now read the token from `~/.local/spellbook/.mcp-token` and include it in the MCP registration.

## [0.30.1] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **Database migration for branch column** - Existing installations crashed on daemon startup because the new `branch` column was missing from the `memories` table. Added `ALTER TABLE` migration that checks for the column before creating the index.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Branch-aware memory system** - Memories are now scoped to the git branch where they were created. Recall scoring boosts memories from the current branch (1.5x) and ancestors (1.2x), penalizes unrelated branches (0.8x). Two-phase scoring: SQL over-fetch with base score, then Python re-rank with ancestry-aware multipliers via `git merge-base --is-ancestor`. New `branch_ancestry` module with LRU-cached ancestry checks. New `memory_branches` junction table for M:N branch-memory associations.
- **Namespace unification** - Worktrees now resolve to the main repository root for consistent project identification. New `resolve_repo_root()` in `path_utils` uses `git worktree list --porcelain` to find the main worktree.

### Fixed
- **Windows path handling** - `resolve_repo_root` now normalizes git output with `os.path.normpath` so paths use OS-native separators. `encode_cwd` handles both backslash and forward slash separators. Bash hook tests skip on Windows.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Fractal-thinking integration for roundtable ITERATE path** - When a roundtable returns ITERATE with escalation conditions (2+ iterations on same stage or 2+ blocking-severity items), `reflexion-analyze` now invokes fractal-thinking for deep exploration before retrying. New `fractal_feedback` module maps fractal harvest output to Feedback instances. Enhanced `_determine_return_stage()` with fractal-informed stage recommendations and distance-based confirmation guardrails. Simple/first-time ITERATEs continue using plain reflexion with zero overhead.
- **Explicit memory integration in Tier 1 skills** - Added `memory_recall` calls at investigation/decision start points and `memory_store_memories` calls at key output moments in 5 skills: verifying-hunches, debugging, implementing-features, code-review, and advanced-code-review. Closes the learn-and-recall loop that was previously limited to passive file-path auto-injection via hooks.

## [0.28.1] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **Update checker no longer falls back to unreleased versions** - When the GitHub releases API is unavailable (no `gh` CLI or network failure), the update checker now reports no update instead of falling back to `git show origin/main:.version`, which would include unreleased and pre-release versions.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- **Consolidated verification skill hardening** - Hardened fact-checking, devil's advocate, and dehallucination skills with shared evidence hierarchy (6 tiers from code trace to LLM knowledge), mandatory depth escalation protocol (shallow/medium/deep), and 6 mandatory Inconclusive conditions. Devil's advocate now uses READY/NEEDS WORK/NOT READY/INCONCLUSIVE verdicts instead of hardcoded issue minimums. Added two new implementing-features phases: Phase 1.5.7 (Dehallucination Gate) and Phase 2.5 (Assumption Verification). Created shared reference at `skills/shared-references/evidence-hierarchy.md`.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- **Memory consolidation refactor** - Replaced LLM-based memory consolidation with four heuristic strategies (content-hash dedup, Jaccard word similarity, tag grouping, temporal clustering). Removed `anthropic` from production dependencies. Added two new MCP tools (`memory_get_unconsolidated`, `memory_store_memories`) for optional client-side LLM synthesis.

### Fixed
- **Daemon PATH detection** - Resolve CLI tool paths at install time via `shutil.which()` so tools installed through mise, asdf, and other version managers are found by the daemon.
- **Update checker** - Use GitHub releases API instead of `git show origin/main:.version` to determine latest version, which naturally excludes pre-releases and drafts.
- **Pre-release workflow** - Auto-release now creates pre-releases by default so releases can be reviewed before promotion.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **MCP server security hardening** - Comprehensive security hardening based on 45-source audit covering industry CVEs, OWASP agentic security guidance, and MCP-specific attack research. Fixes 13 identified vulnerabilities including an RCE kill chain through workflow state, command injection in terminal construction, and injection via DB-sourced recovery context. Adds bearer token authentication for HTTP transport via FastMCP middleware, connection health checks with TTL, boot prompt validation with context-aware parsing, Shannon entropy detection for obfuscated payloads, and path traversal protection for spawn sessions. Removes permissive security mode entirely. Includes SECURITY.md with threat model and responsible disclosure policy. ([45 cited sources](docs/security.md))
- **Memory system** - Project-scoped knowledge persistence with FTS5 search, namespace isolation, and importance scoring. Memories are stored in the spellbook database and recalled across sessions.

## [0.25.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- **polish-repo-community: avoid content filter on CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - The Contributor Covenant full text contains policy language that triggers API content filtering (400 errors). The skill now prefers fetching the canonical file via curl, falls back to a short linking stub, or directs users to GitHub's built-in generator.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-03-06

### Changed
- **Installer output redesign** - Prettier terminal output with box-drawing section headers, unicode tree characters (`├─`/`└─`) for hierarchy, consistent status icons (`✓`/`→`/`⊘`/`✗`), elapsed time display, and no double blank lines. Fixed double banner on uv re-execution and platform counter bug. Added UTF-8 stdout/stderr reconfiguration for Windows compatibility.
- **Rename project-presence to polish-repo** - All skills, commands, and docs renamed from `project-presence-*` to `polish-repo-*` for easier recall.
- **Expand community engagement guidance** - Added concrete brainstorming sources (README gaps, architectural debt, ecosystem integrations, etc.) for contributor magnets and conversation starters in the polish-repo-community command.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **polish-repo skill** - New skill for improving open source project discoverability and presentation without relying on social media. Includes 5 phase commands covering README authoring (scratch/improve/replace), naming workshops, visual identity briefs, community infrastructure, and a 100-point audit scoring rubric. Based on analysis of 50+ open source projects across Python, Go, JS, and Rust ecosystems.
- **Community infrastructure** - Issue templates (bug report + feature request) using GitHub YAML form format, lightweight PR template, CONTRIBUTING.md with dev setup and skill authoring guide, SECURITY.md with spellbook-specific vulnerability scope, and a welcome bot GitHub Action for first-time contributors.
- **GitHub topics** - Added 15 topics for discoverability (ai-assistant, claude, mcp, python, etc.)
- **Homepage URL** - Set to docs site for repo metadata completeness.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-05

### Changed
- **Replace encyclopedia with AGENTS.md project knowledge** - The encyclopedia concept (`~/.local/spellbook/docs/<project>/encyclopedia.md`) is replaced by standard `AGENTS.md` files within project repositories. AGENTS.md is version-controlled, benefits all contributors, and uses the standard Claude Code convention. Session start now checks for AGENTS.md instead of encyclopedia.
- **Expand opportunity awareness** - Agents now also watch for project knowledge candidates (undocumented conventions, build commands, gotchas) and suggest adding them to AGENTS.md.
- **Update spellbook AGENTS.md** - Added quick-start commands, key conventions, pre-commit hook guidance, and architecture notes for AI assistants working on the spellbook repo itself.

### Deprecated
- **project-encyclopedia skill** - Use AGENTS.md files instead. Will be removed in a future version.
- **encyclopedia-build command** - Use AGENTS.md files instead. Will be removed in a future version.
- **encyclopedia-validate command** - Use AGENTS.md files instead. Will be removed in a future version.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Skill Opportunity Awareness** (`AGENTS.spellbook.md`) - Agents now self-monitor for reusable patterns during work and suggest skill, command, or agent candidates at natural pause points. Includes subagent observation convention (`## Skill Observations` output section) for bubbling up discoveries from subagents to the orchestrator.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-05

### Removed
- **Nim hook compilation system** - Removed the 3-tier hook dispatch (Nim > .py > .sh) in favor of a simpler 2-tier system (.sh on Unix, .ps1 on Windows). The `_SHELL_TO_NIM_BINARY` mapping, `nim_available` parameter threading, and `_compile_nim_hooks()` build step are all gone.
- **Python hook wrappers** - Removed all 10 `.py` hook files from `hooks/`. These were intermediate wrappers that called security check modules; the new `.sh` and `.ps1` hooks call them directly.
- **Nim source directory** - Deleted `hooks/nim/` (Nim sources, build config, and codegen).
- **Nim test files** - Deleted `test_nim_hook_binaries.py` and `test_nim_codegen.py`.

### Added
- **PowerShell hooks** - 10 new `.ps1` hooks mirroring every `.sh` hook for native Windows support. Security hooks are fail-closed (exit 2 on error); audit, notification, and compaction hooks are fail-open (exit 0 on error).
- **Legacy hook cleanup** - `_cleanup_legacy_hooks()` automatically removes stale Nim binary and `.py` wrapper entries from `settings.json` during install, preventing conflicts with the new hook paths.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **System notification support** (`spellbook/notify.py`) - Native OS notifications as a visual/accessibility alternative to TTS. Fires macOS Notification Center, Linux `notify-send`, or Windows PowerShell toast when tools exceed a configurable threshold (default 30s). Platform detection handles containers, SSH/headless sessions, and Wayland desktops.
- **Notification MCP tools** - `notify_send`, `notify_status`, `notify_session_set`, `notify_config_set` for manual notifications, availability checking, and per-session or persistent configuration.
- **PostToolUse notification hooks** (`hooks/notify-on-complete.{sh,py}`) - Separate hooks that call platform notification tools directly (no HTTP round-trip, unlike TTS). Independent lifecycle, threshold, and blacklist from TTS hooks.
- **Dual PreToolUse timer files** - `tts-timer-start` hooks now write both `/tmp/claude-tool-start-{id}` (TTS) and `/tmp/claude-notify-start-{id}` (notifications), eliminating race conditions between async hooks.
- **Notification configuration** in `config_tools.py` - Session state (`notify` key), persistent config (`notify_enabled`, `notify_title`), and `SPELLBOOK_NOTIFY_THRESHOLD` / `SPELLBOOK_NOTIFY_ENABLED` environment variables for hook control.
- **Notification test suite** - 76 tests across 4 files: core module, config integration, MCP tools, and hook behavior.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Crystallized v2 outputs** - All skills, commands, patterns, agents, and root documents (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.codex/spellbook-bootstrap.md`, `spellbook/coordination/WORKER_CONTRACT.md`) crystallized to v2 format. Each output verified by adversarial gap analysis before acceptance. FAIL verdicts (CRITICAL or HIGH findings) trigger source-level fixes before the crystallized output is accepted.
- **`skills/reviewing-prs`** - New skill: safe PR review protocol that detects whether the reviewing agent is working in the PR branch (`LOCAL_FILES` mode) or needs a diff-only context block (`DIFF_ONLY` mode), with mandatory injection template for subagent dispatch.

### Changed
- **Crystallize pipeline: compress-first ordering** (`commands/crystallize.md`) - Phase 3 now compresses aggressively first to establish a tight baseline before filling gaps. Previously, improvement design preceded compression, producing net-additive outputs. MEDIUM/LOW gap fills must be net-neutral (offset by equal compression); only CRITICAL/HIGH gaps may add net content.
- **Crystallize calibration preservation rule** (`commands/crystallize.md`) - Preserving calibration content means preserving the identified failure mode and correction, not the word count. A 3-sentence note condensed to 1 sentence that still names the failure mode is acceptable.
- **TDD skill sharpened** (`skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`) - Exceptions block clarifies "no human available? default: apply TDD". Mock rationale expanded: "unavoidable = external I/O, time, hardware -- not laziness". REFACTOR completion criteria added.
- **Multiple skills compressed and tightened** - `skills/advanced-code-review`, `skills/auditing-green-mirage`, `skills/debugging`, `skills/dispatching-parallel-agents`, `skills/fixing-tests`, `skills/generating-diagrams`, `skills/implementing-features`, `skills/writing-skills`, `commands/advanced-code-review-verify`, `commands/code-review-give`.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Full Assertion Principle** (`patterns/assertion-quality-standard.md`) - New foundational rule: ALL assertions must be full, for ALL output regardless of whether it is static or dynamic. Tests MUST assert exact equality against the complete expected output. For dynamic content, construct the expected value dynamically and assert `==`; do not use partial checks. `assert "substring" in result` is BANNED unconditionally. No exceptions. Added as Invariant Principles #1 and #2, with new sections for Mock Call Assertions and Side Effects. Previously introduced as "Deterministic Output Principle" (too narrow; renamed and expanded).
- **Mock call assertion enforcement** (`patterns/assertion-quality-standard.md`) - When a dependency is mocked, tests MUST assert EVERY call with ALL arguments and verify call count. `mock.ANY` is BANNED -- construct the expected argument dynamically if needed. `assert_called()` without argument verification is BANNED. Partial mock assertion (asserting only some calls, or some args) is BANNED.
- **Side effects assertion requirement** (`patterns/assertion-quality-standard.md`) - Every observable side effect must be asserted completely: database writes (all fields), file writes (full content), events (all payload fields), queue messages (all fields). Returning the correct value while ignoring side effects is a Green Mirage.
- **Green Mirage Pattern 10: "Strengthened Assertion That Is Still Partial"** (`commands/audit-mirage-analyze.md`) - Catches fixes that replace one weak assertion with another (e.g., replacing `assert len(x) > 0` with `assert "keyword" in result`). Both are BANNED. A real fix must reach Level 4+.
- **Phase 3.5: Mandatory Post-Fix Adversarial Review** (`skills/fixing-tests/SKILL.md`) - After all fixes are applied, a Test Adversary subagent verifies every new assertion meets Level 4+ and checks for Pattern 10 violations. Previously, adversarial review was only available through the green mirage audit's end-to-end flow.
- **Inline assertion quality requirements in fix-tests-execute** (`commands/fix-tests-execute.md`) - The fix execution prompt now embeds the Full Assertion Principle, BANNED patterns list (including mock.ANY and incomplete mock calls), and per-assertion verification requirements directly. Previously relied on orchestrator to append the Test Writer Template, which was not enforced.
- **Anti-Pattern 7: Partial-to-Partial Upgrades** (`skills/test-driven-development/testing-anti-patterns.md`) - New testing anti-pattern covering fixes that move from one BANNED assertion level to another without reaching Level 4+.

### Changed
- **Pattern 2 renamed from "CODE SMELL" to "BANNED"** (`commands/audit-mirage-analyze.md`) - Pattern 2 (Partial Assertions) changed from "CODE SMELL - INVESTIGATE DEEPER" to "Partial Assertion on Any Output (BANNED)". Language changed from investigative to prohibitive. Applies to all output regardless of determinism.
- **Phase 7 Fix Verification made MANDATORY** (`skills/auditing-green-mirage/SKILL.md`) - Was conditional on "end-to-end" usage; now required whenever fixes are written through any path. New Step 0 (Full Assertion Check) runs before all other analysis, covering all output types and mock call assertions.
- **Assertion Quality Gate expanded to ALL modes** (`skills/fixing-tests/SKILL.md`) - Was only enforced in `audit_report` mode; now applies to `general_instructions` and `run_and_fix` modes too.
- **Subagent dispatch prompts require explicit Read() directives** - All test-related subagent prompts across `auditing-green-mirage`, `fixing-tests`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, and `feature-implement` now include explicit "Read these files in full" instructions and anti-shortcut mandates. Changed "Load" to "Read" throughout.
- **Test Writer Template strengthened** (`skills/dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md`) - Full Assertion Principle as Rule 0 (all output, not just deterministic), mock call assertion requirements as Rule 6, additional BANNED patterns (multiple partials, tautological assertions, mock.ANY), no partial-to-partial upgrade mandate.
- **Test Adversary Template strengthened** (`skills/dispatching-parallel-agents/SKILL.md`) - Added immediate rejection criteria, Full Assertion Principle in verdicts, Pattern 10 detection in summary, mock.ANY as immediate rejection.
- **TDD skill assertion rules table** (`skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`) - Renamed columns to "BANNED Pattern / CORRECT Pattern" with explicit Level labels. Added rows for multiple partials, tautological assertions, mock.ANY, and incomplete mock call assertions. New CRITICAL section for Full Assertion Principle.
- **Code quality checklists** (`skills/enforcing-code-quality/SKILL.md`) - Added Full Assertion Principle enforcement, mock.ANY ban, every-mock-call-with-all-args requirement, Pattern 10 awareness, and tautological assertion ban.
- **Green mirage pattern count** - Updated all references from "9 Green Mirage Patterns" to "10 Green Mirage Patterns" and "patterns 1-8" to "patterns 1-10" across skills and commands.
- **Effort estimation tables** - "Strengthen partial assertions" replaced with "replace partial assertions with exact equality (Level 4+)" in audit skill and command.
- **Code review anti-patterns** (`patterns/code-review-antipatterns.md`) - Green Mirage detection heuristics updated with BANNED substring pattern (all output, not just deterministic), Pattern 10 reference, Full Assertion Principle cross-reference, mock.ANY ban, and incomplete mock call assertion ban.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Assertion quality standard pattern** (`patterns/assertion-quality-standard.md`) - Shared reference document defining the Assertion Strength Ladder (5 levels for string, object, and collection output), the Bare Substring Problem, the Broken Implementation Test (mutation check annotation), and justification requirements. Referenced by TDD, green mirage audit, fixing-tests, and code quality skills.
- **Fix verification phase for green mirage audit** - Phase 7 in `auditing-green-mirage` closes the audit-to-fix loop with a Test Adversary subagent that applies ESCAPE analysis and assertion ladder classification to every new assertion
- **Specialized subagent templates** (`dispatching-parallel-agents`) - Test Writer and Test Adversary templates for consistent assertion quality enforcement when dispatching test-writing or test-reviewing subagents
- **Assertion quality gate for fixing-tests** - `audit_report` mode loads the assertion quality standard and rejects assertions below Level 4 on the Assertion Strength Ladder

### Changed
- **TDD skill assertion rules expanded** - Added bare substring ban, string containment position requirement, and MUTATION field to ESCAPE analysis template
- **Code quality checklists updated** - Both pre-completion and post-implementation checklists now require Level 4+ assertions per the Assertion Strength Ladder

## [0.16.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Assertion quality enforcement across skill system** - Defense-in-depth approach to prevent green mirage tests (tests that pass but don't validate correctness)
  - **TDD skill**: Mandatory ESCAPE analysis per test function (5-field template: CLAIM/PATH/CHECK/ESCAPE/IMPACT), assertion quality rules banning `len() > 0`, `len() == N`, `mock.ANY`, and existence-only checks without content verification. 4 new self-check items enforce compliance.
  - **Testing anti-patterns**: New Anti-Pattern 6 (Existence-Only Assertions) with violation examples, fix examples, pychoir exception rule, and gate function. Cross-references Green Mirage Pattern 1.
  - **Green mirage audit**: Worked ESCAPE example showing good vs bad analysis of a weak test. Pattern 1 expanded to detect count-only (`len() == N`) and wildcard matcher (`mock.ANY`, `unittest.mock.ANY`) assertions. Pattern 2 expanded with pychoir/matcher investigation point.
  - **Implementing-features**: SIMPLE tier no longer exempts green mirage audit. All tiers now run the audit when tests are written or updated. Fact-checking exemption remains for SIMPLE tier.

### Fixed
- **Green mirage pattern count** - Fixed stale reference "8 Green Mirage Patterns" to "9 Green Mirage Patterns" in auditing-green-mirage skill

## [0.15.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **TTS plays to stale audio device** - Changing the system default output device after the MCP daemon started had no effect; playback always targeted the device that was default at startup. PortAudio now re-initializes before each playback to pick up the current system default (`spellbook/tts.py`)

## [0.15.1] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Bump dependencies** - fastapi 0.128.0 -> 0.134.0, @types/node 20.19.30 -> 25.3.3, @opencode-ai/plugin 1.2.14 -> 1.2.15, @opencode-ai/sdk 1.2.14 -> 1.2.15, actions/upload-artifact v6 -> v7

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Compiled Nim hooks with shell fallbacks** - All 9 Claude Code hooks now have native Nim implementations that launch in ~5ms instead of ~200ms for Python/shell scripts. Includes a codegen pipeline (`hooks/nim/generate_patterns.py`) that reads security rules from Python and generates a Nim module with pre-compiled regex patterns and SHA1 hash verification. If Nim is not installed or any hook fails to compile, all hooks fall back to shell scripts (all-or-none strategy).
  - **9 Nim hook binaries**: `tts_timer_start`, `bash_gate`, `spawn_guard`, `state_sanitize`, `audit_log`, `canary_check`, `tts_notify`, `pre_compact_save`, `post_compact_recover`
  - **Shared hooklib module** (`hooks/nim/src/hooklib.nim`): JSON stdin parsing, recursive string extraction, MCP JSON-RPC client with SSE response parsing, fail-open/fail-closed exit handlers, SHA1 hash verification
  - **Security pattern sync**: Generated patterns include SHA1 hash of source rules; at runtime, hooks verify the hash and fall back to MCP `security_check_tool_input` if patterns are stale
  - **Installer integration**: `_detect_nim()` checks for Nim >= 1.6, `_compile_nim_hooks()` builds all binaries, `nim_available` flag propagated through hook registration to select Nim binary or shell fallback per hook
- **`security_check_tool_input` MCP tool** - New tool that validates tool call inputs against security rules, used as runtime fallback when Nim hooks detect stale compiled patterns (`spellbook/server.py`)

### Changed
- **Green mirage audit expanded** - Added detection of skipped, xfailed, or disabled tests hiding real failures (`commands/audit-green-mirage.md`, `commands/audit-mirage-analyze.md`, `commands/audit-mirage-cross.md`, `commands/audit-mirage-report.md`, `skills/auditing-green-mirage/SKILL.md`)
- **Mermaid diagram guidance** - Added rule to use `<br>` for newlines within mermaid node labels instead of literal newlines (`AGENTS.spellbook.md`)

## [0.14.0] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Rename CLAUDE.md to AGENTS.md** - Project development instructions now live in `AGENTS.md` (platform-agnostic naming). `CLAUDE.md` remains as a thin shim pointing to `AGENTS.md`. User-facing template renamed from `CLAUDE.spellbook.md` to `AGENTS.spellbook.md`. Installation targets unchanged (Claude Code still writes to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).
- **Rename `get_spellbook_claude_md_content` to `get_spellbook_context_content`** - Function in `installer/components/context_files.py` renamed to reflect platform-agnostic naming. Backward-compatible alias retained.
- **Shell/PowerShell parity rule** - Added development rule requiring shell script changes to have corresponding PowerShell/Python wrapper changes (`AGENTS.md`).

### Fixed
- **Hook format validation errors on startup** - `bash-gate.sh` and `spawn-guard.sh` were registered as plain string paths instead of the required object format `{"type": "command", "command": "..."}`. Claude Code rejected these on startup with a settings validation error (`installer/components/hooks.py`).
- **Hooks installed to wrong settings file** - Installer wrote hooks to `~/.claude/settings.local.json`, which Claude Code does not read for hooks at the user level. Changed to `~/.claude/settings.json` (`installer/platforms/claude_code.py`).

## [0.13.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- **IndexError in TTS notification hook** - `shlex.split(cmd)[0]` crashes when the command string is empty or whitespace-only; now guards against empty list before indexing (`hooks/tts-notify.py`, `hooks/tts-notify.sh`)
- **Bare except in TTS notification hook** - Narrowed `except:` to `except ValueError:` so `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt` propagate correctly (`hooks/tts-notify.sh`)
- **3x file I/O in `tts_config_set`** - Refactored to use new `config_set_many()` for a single atomic read-modify-write cycle instead of three separate `config_set()` calls (`spellbook/server.py`, `spellbook/config_tools.py`)
- **Import organization in MCP server** - Grouped all stdlib imports together before version detection logic per PEP 8 (`spellbook/server.py`)
- **Nonexistent `@types/node@^25.3.0`** - Pinned to `^22.0.0` across all three OpenCode extension package.json files
- **Nonexistent `python:3.14-slim` Docker image** - Changed to `python:3.13-slim` in test Dockerfile
- **Inconsistent `package-lock.json`** - Regenerated lockfile for `extensions/opencode/context-curator` to resolve nested SDK version mismatch
- **Test tier time boundary inconsistency** - Aligned integration tier to "1-5s" and E2E/Slow to ">5s" to match the `slow` mark definition (`CLAUDE.spellbook.md`)
- **Ambiguous `gpu / hardware` test mark** - Changed to comma-separated `` `gpu`, `hardware` `` to clarify these are two distinct pytest marks (`CLAUDE.spellbook.md`)
- **"All 5 escape strategies" text outdated** - Changed to "escape strategies 1-5" since fractal exploration is now strategy 6 (`commands/deep-research-investigate.md`)
- **`VALID_CHECKPOINT_MODES` undocumented pattern** - Added comment explaining that `depth:N` patterns are also valid but validated separately (`spellbook/fractal/models.py`)
- **Fractal harvest word count ranges unclear** - Labeled each range with its intensity level inline (`commands/fractal-think-harvest.md`)

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Fractal-thinking redesign: recursive primitive architecture** - Replaced the 3-phase pipeline (Init/Explore/Synthesize) with a single self-similar recursive primitive and worker-based execution model
  - **New execution model**: Workers pull tasks from a SQL-based work queue with branch affinity and work stealing, instead of round-based cluster dispatch
  - **Bottom-up synthesis**: Each node synthesizes locally from children's results; synthesis cascades upward through the graph rather than being imposed top-down
  - **New MCP tools**: `fractal_claim_work`, `fractal_synthesize_node`, `fractal_get_claimable_work`, `fractal_get_ready_to_synthesize` (17 total fractal tools)
  - **New node statuses**: `claimed` (work in progress) and `synthesized` (local synthesis complete) with schema v1-to-v2 migration
  - **Commands renamed**: `fractal-think-init` -> `fractal-think-seed`, `fractal-think-explore` -> `fractal-think-work`, `fractal-think-synthesize` -> `fractal-think-harvest`
  - **Worker termination**: Workers exit only when no open AND no claimed nodes remain, preventing premature exit race conditions
  - **Budget-exhausted recovery**: Graphs in `budget_exhausted` status can now transition to `active` (for synthesis repair) or `completed`
- **CLAUDE.spellbook.md testing section** - Expanded from single rule to comprehensive test execution strategy: minimum viable test run principle, test tiers table (unit/integration/E2E), change-scoped test selection, batching guidance, writing-tests-for-speed checklist, test marks table, and cross-module regression debugging
- **test-driven-development skill** - Added `Fast` quality row to Good Tests table and new `Test Speed & Scope` section covering resource isolation, input minimization, mark application, and change-scoped test runs
- **fixing-tests skill** - Added `Slow/bloated tests` special case covering mark separation, I/O tier demotion, input shrinking, and fixture weight checks

### Fixed
- **TTS survives daemon venv rebuilds** - When the daemon venv is rebuilt (lockfile hash change), TTS dependencies are now preserved if the user previously opted in
  - `install_daemon()` checks `tts_enabled` config and passes `include_tts=True` to `ensure_daemon_venv()` so TTS deps are included in rebuilds
  - `setup_tts()` detects when TTS was enabled but deps are missing (venv rebuilt) and automatically reinstalls them
  - Fixed misplaced `return` in `setup_tts()` that caused it to silently skip TTS reinstallation
- **spacy model installed during TTS setup** - Kokoro's dependency chain (kokoro -> misaki -> spacy) requires the `en_core_web_sm` language model, which spacy tries to auto-download via `pip install` at runtime. This fails in uv-managed venvs (no pip). The installer now pre-installs the spacy model wheel directly from GitHub Releases via uv during TTS setup.
- **Kokoro model cache detection** - Fixed glob pattern for HuggingFace cache detection (`models--hexgrad--Kokoro*` instead of `models--hexagon*kokoro*`)
- **Kokoro deprecation warning** - Pass explicit `repo_id='hexgrad/Kokoro-82M'` to suppress defaulting warning
- **TTS hook announcements never firing** - Catch-all hooks used `"matcher": ".*"` which Claude Code does not reliably fire. Fixed to omit the `matcher` key entirely (the documented approach for matching all tools). Installer now migrates legacy `".*"`, `"*"`, and `""` matchers on re-install.
- **Daemon venv missing pip causing TTS hangs** - `uv venv` was called without `--seed`, so the daemon venv had no `pip` package. spaCy's runtime pip invocations (spaCy#13747) would hang. Added `--seed` flag to seed pip into the venv at creation time.

### Added
- **Post-compaction context recovery** - Automatically saves and restores orchestrator identity, skill constraints, and workflow state across Claude Code context compactions
  - PreCompact hook (`pre-compact-save.sh`) saves workflow state to MCP daemon before compaction, with fail-open design and 2s timeout budget
  - SessionStart hook (`post-compact-recover.sh`) injects recovery context after compaction via `additionalContext`, with fallback directive when daemon unreachable
  - Enhanced boot prompt with Section 0.6 (orchestrator identity), 0.7 (skill FORBIDDEN/REQUIRED constraints), 0.8 (binding decisions) for post-compaction recovery
  - `get_resume_fields()` now queries `workflow_state` table alongside `souls` for richer resume context
  - `_get_skill_constraints()` extracts FORBIDDEN/REQUIRED sections from SKILL.md files as behavioral guardrails
  - Workflow state validation in `workflow_state_save` (rejects invalid keys) and `workflow_state_load` (warns on invalid keys)
  - Hook registration in installer for both PreCompact and SessionStart phases
  - 59 new tests across hook scripts, resume flow, and boot prompt generation
- **TTS model preloading at daemon startup** - Kokoro model now loads in a background thread when the daemon starts, eliminating the ~100s cold-start delay on first `kokoro_speak` call. Preload is skipped if TTS is disabled or dependencies are unavailable.
- **Daemon install test suite** - 39 tests in `tests/test_daemon_install.py` covering centralized daemon install ordering, platform installer negative tests, `check_daemon_health()`, `get_daemon_python()` symlink preservation, `_get_repairs()` find_spec usage, `ensure_daemon_venv()` hash detection, TTS config inclusion in `install_daemon()`, and `setup_tts()` reinstall behavior

## [0.12.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Fractal-thinking integration** - Added optional fractal exploration hooks to 14 existing skills, commands, and agents
  - 5 high-value: design-exploration, debugging (3-Fix Rule), devil's advocate, feature-discover, deep-research-investigate
  - 2 medium-high: analyzing-domains, review-design-verify
  - 7 medium: fact-check-verify, write-skill-test, reflexion-analyze, security-auditing, gathering-requirements, crystallize, hierophant-distiller
  - Consistent pattern: trigger condition, intensity level (pulse/explore), seed template, synthesis usage
  - All integrations are optional and non-breaking (markdown instruction changes only)

### Fixed
- **TTS debugging and installer improvements**
  - Fix `kokoro_status` returning misleading `error: null` by calling `_check_availability()` in `get_status()` so actual import errors are reported
  - Fix installer silently skipping TTS when kokoro not installed; now offers to install TTS dependencies interactively
  - Add pip to TTS install flow as workaround for spaCy#13747 (spaCy hangs in uv-managed venvs without pip)
  - Add repairs framework to `session_init` that detects broken TTS config and suggests fix commands
- **MCP server resource cleanup** - Garbage collection and memory reclamation for the long-running MCP daemon
  - SQLite context managers: wrapped all raw `sqlite3.connect()` calls in `try/finally` blocks across health.py, security/tools.py, security/check.py, and server.py to prevent connection leaks on exceptions
  - Bounded compaction tracking: converted `_processed_compactions` from unbounded set to time-expiring dict (1-hour TTL) in SessionWatcher
  - Database pruning: added periodic `_cleanup_stale_data()` to SessionWatcher that prunes old rows from high-volume tables (souls, security_events, skill_outcomes, subagents, decisions, corrections, forge_tokens, tool_analytics, reflections)
  - Graceful shutdown: registered `atexit` hook in server.py to stop watcher threads and close all SQLite connection caches

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Fractal thinking skill** - Persistent recursive thought engine for deep exploration via 13 MCP tools, SQLite-backed graph storage, and 3 phase commands (`/fractal-think-init`, `/fractal-think-explore`, `/fractal-think-synthesize`)
  - Three intensity levels (pulse/explore/deep) with configurable depth and agent budgets
  - Four checkpoint modes (autonomous, convergence, interactive, depth:N)
  - Convergence and contradiction detection across graph branches
  - Branch saturation tracking with automatic status propagation
  - Separate `fractal.db` with WAL mode and schema versioning
  - Server-side depth budget enforcement and graph status validation
  - 246 tests across 8 test files including end-to-end integration

## [0.11.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **pytest-timeout** - Global 30s timeout prevents any single test from hanging the entire suite
- **pytest-xdist** - Enables parallel test execution with `pytest -n auto`
- **Test marks for targeted running** - `@pytest.mark.integration` (13 files), `@pytest.mark.slow` (2 files), `@pytest.mark.external` (1 file)
- **Subprocess timeouts** - All `subprocess.run()` calls in tests now have explicit `timeout=30`

### Changed
- **Consolidated pytest config** - Deleted `pytest.ini`, moved all config to `pyproject.toml`

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Kokoro TTS MCP integration** - Text-to-speech via 4 MCP tools (`tts_speak`, `tts_settings`, `tts_set_voice`, `tts_list_voices`), lazy-loaded model, per-session overrides
- **FastMCP v3 compatibility** - Version detection and compat shim for both FastMCP v2 and v3
- **`$SPELLBOOK_DIR` expansion in hooks** - Hook paths now use absolute paths instead of unexpanded variables

### Changed
- **Dependabot rollup** - Bumped 15 dependencies across pip, npm, and GitHub Actions

## [0.10.1] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **Dependabot configuration** - Automated dependency update PRs for all package ecosystems: pip, GitHub Actions, Go modules, Docker, and npm (tests + OpenCode extensions)
- **Dependabot coverage pre-commit hook** - `check_dependabot_coverage.py` flags any new package manifest (package.json, go.mod, Dockerfile, etc.) not covered by `.github/dependabot.yml`
- **Book-only SVG** - `docs/assets/book.svg` variant of the logo without the star

### Fixed
- **CI test failures on macOS and Linux** - `TestGeminiInstallerIntegration` was calling `install_daemon()` with the real project root, installing an actual launchd/systemd service on CI runners. Mocked `install_daemon` in the test and hardened `test_is_installed_*` tests to use tmp_path-based paths.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- **creating-issues-and-pull-requests skill** - New library skill for template-aware PR and issue creation
  - 4-tier template discovery: local filesystem, GraphQL API, org-level `.github` repo fallback, sensible default
  - Fork-aware: detects cross-repo PRs, uses base repo's templates, confirms target repository
  - YAML issue form support with interactive field walkthrough and `--web` escape hatch
  - Safe `gh` CLI patterns: always `--body-file`, never `--fill`/`--template`/`gh pr edit`
  - Jira-aware PR naming: extracts ticket from branch name, never fabricates
  - Split into orchestrator skill + `/create-pr` and `/create-issue` commands

### Changed
- **All platforms now use HTTP daemon transport** - Removed stdio transport entirely. Gemini CLI, Codex, and Crush now connect to the shared HTTP daemon at `127.0.0.1:8765` (same as Claude Code and OpenCode). Eliminates cold-start latency and fixes Gemini CLI "MCP error -32000: Connection closed" during discovery.
  - `extensions/gemini/gemini-extension.json`: switched from `command`/`args` to `httpUrl`
  - `installer/platforms/gemini.py`: added `install_daemon()` step
  - `installer/platforms/codex.py`: switched TOML config from stdio to HTTP
  - `installer/platforms/crush.py`: switched JSON config from `type: stdio` to `type: http`
  - `spellbook/server.py`: removed stdio-specific UpdateWatcher deferral
  - `spellbook/update_watcher.py`: removed transport parameter (HTTP-only)
- **Docker tests skip by default** - Added `docker` pytest marker; docker tests only run in CI with `--run-docker` flag. Reduces local test suite from ~48min to ~2min.

### Fixed
- **SPELLBOOK_CONFIG_DIR no longer inherits CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR** - Setting `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` previously caused `SPELLBOOK_CONFIG_DIR` to use the same value as a fallback. These are independent concerns: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` controls where Claude Code installs its artifacts (skills, commands), while `SPELLBOOK_CONFIG_DIR` controls where spellbook stores its work files. The fallback has been removed from `installer/config.py`, `installer/components/context_files.py`, and `installer/ui.py`.

## [0.9.12] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Windows support (beta)** - Cross-platform installation and runtime for Windows
  - `bootstrap.ps1`: PowerShell bootstrap script for Windows installation
  - `installer/compat.py`: Cross-platform abstraction layer (10 functions + 2 classes) for path handling, symlinks, and service management

  - Service management via Windows Task Scheduler (`schtasks`)
  - Python hook equivalents (`.py`) for all 5 security hooks (bash-gate, spawn-guard, state-sanitize, audit-log, canary-check)
  - `spellbook-watchdog.py`: Windows process watchdog for MCP server lifecycle
  - Windows CI runner in GitHub Actions test matrix (ubuntu, macos, windows)
  - 115 Windows hook tests (83 cross-platform + 32 Windows-only behavioral tests)
  - 71 unit tests for `installer/compat.py`
  - PowerShell bootstrap tests with syntax validation

### Fixed
- **Cross-platform test suite** - Made ~120 tests portable across all 3 OS platforms
  - Path separator assertions use `os.path` instead of hardcoded forward slashes
  - UTF-8 encoding specified for file operations handling Unicode content
  - Platform-aware hook extension assertions (`.sh` vs `.py`)
  - Lock file tests read via held fd instead of reopening (Windows `msvcrt` compat)
  - Resume path regex matches both `/` and `\` separators
- **FastMCP version pinned** to `>=2.0.0,<3` to prevent breaking API changes
- **bootstrap.ps1** checks `$LASTEXITCODE` after `git clone` (PowerShell `$ErrorActionPreference` doesn't catch external command failures)
- **Docker test stability** - Tolerates benign git warnings ("dubious ownership") in `_assert_install_ok()`
- **Concurrent checkpoint test** - Retry logic for file lock contention under thread pressure

## [0.9.11] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **generating-diagrams skill** - New skill for creating Mermaid and Graphviz DOT workflow diagrams with source-traced nodes

- **Auto-update system** - Two-phase update architecture for spellbook installations
  - Detection phase: read-only git fetch inside MCP server
  - Application phase: subprocess running installer with git-based rollback
  - Transport-aware scheduling: stdio checks on startup only, HTTP daemons check on startup + configurable interval
  - Major version consent gate, lock file concurrency protection, session greeting notifications
  - New MCP tools: `spellbook_update_check`, `spellbook_update_apply`, `spellbook_update_config`

### Removed
- **Skill registry from CLAUDE.spellbook.md** - Platforms discover skills directly via native mechanisms, making the embedded registry redundant. Simplified `generate_context.py` and `update_context_files.py`.

## [0.9.10] - 2026-02-19

  - Added concrete before/after synthesis example showing rate limiting + sanitization conflict with WRONG (ours), WRONG (theirs), and CORRECT (synthesis) resolutions
  - Strengthened self-check with Mechanical Synthesis Test: describe each resolution in one sentence; if it contains "kept X's version" or "went with ours/theirs", you are selecting, not synthesizing
- **merging-worktrees skill** - Added Pre-Conflict Gate requiring `resolving-merge-conflicts` skill to be loaded in subagent context before any conflict resolution, preventing LLM base-model bias toward ours/theirs selection
- **dispatching-parallel-agents skill** - Added Context Minimization Protocol and Subagent Dispatch Template sections (moved from CLAUDE.spellbook.md)
- **finishing-a-development-branch skill** - Added Branch-Relative Documentation section (moved from CLAUDE.spellbook.md)

  - 20+ test files with ~1,000 security-specific tests

## [0.9.9] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Branch-Relative Documentation rule** - New inviolable rule in CLAUDE.spellbook.md requiring changelogs, PR descriptions, PR titles, and code comments to reflect only the merge-base diff, not session-by-session development history. Includes prohibition on historical code comments and a first-time reader test.

- **Mechanical phase-skip prevention** - implementing-features skill now enforces phase sequencing with bash artifact checks at sub-command entry points
  - Each sub-command (feature-research, feature-discover, feature-design, feature-implement) has a MANDATORY PREREQUISITE CHECK block that verifies prior phase artifacts exist before proceeding
  - Checks include tier verification, artifact existence (ls commands), and anti-rationalization reminders
- **Task Complexity Router** - New Phase 0.7 in feature-config classifies tasks into 4 tiers using mechanical heuristics

- **Multi-Phase Skill Architecture mandate** - writing-skills skill now requires orchestrator-subagent separation for multi-phase skills
  - 3+ phase skills MUST separate orchestrator from phase commands; 2 phases SHOULD; 1 phase exempt
  - Core rule: orchestrator dispatches subagents (Task tool), subagents invoke phase commands (Skill tool), orchestrator never invokes commands directly
  - Content split matrix defines what belongs in orchestrator (<300 lines: phase sequence, dispatch templates, shared data structures) vs phase commands (implementation logic, scoring, wizards)
  - Data structure placement criterion: referenced by 2+ phases = orchestrator, 1 phase = command
  - Exceptions for config/setup phases requiring user interaction and error recovery
  - 4 named anti-patterns for context bloat
  - Self-Check updated with multi-phase compliance checkbox
- **Skill analyzer tests** - 31 unit tests covering extraction, correction detection, version parsing, metrics aggregation

### Changed
- **Multi-Phase Skill Architecture compliance** - Refactored all 12 non-compliant skills to separate orchestrator SKILL.md from phase command files

  - Skill becomes thin orchestrator, commands contain phase logic
- **Orchestrator pattern reinforcement** - Updated CLAUDE.spellbook.md and workflow skills
  - Clarified orchestrator role: dispatch subagents, don't do work in main context
  - Added OpenCode agent inheritance (YOLO type propagation to subagents)
- **Skill size reduction** - Major skills condensed to fit OpenCode's 50KB tool output limit
  - `implementing-features`: 90KB → under 50KB (phased command approach)

  - Removed inaccurate Origin columns from Skills/Commands/Agents tables
  - Added † markers to indicate Superpowers-derived items
  - Created dedicated Acknowledgments table with verified mappings

### Fixed
- **Session counts shared between projects** - MCP tools now use the client's working directory from MCP roots instead of the server's `os.getcwd()`. This fixes sessions appearing shared across all projects because the MCP server process has a different cwd than Claude Code.
  - Added `get_project_path_from_context()` and `get_project_dir_from_context()` async functions to extract project path from MCP roots
  - Converted `find_session`, `list_sessions`, `spawn_claude_session`, `spellbook_check_compaction`, `spellbook_context_ping`, `spellbook_session_init`, and `spellbook_analytics_summary` to async
  - Updated `inject_recovery_context` decorator to support async functions
  - Falls back to `os.getcwd()` when roots are unavailable for backward compatibility
- **OpenCode HTTP transport** - Use HTTP transport to connect to spellbook MCP daemon instead of stdio
- **Deprecated datetime.utcnow()** - Replaced with datetime.now(UTC) throughout codebase
