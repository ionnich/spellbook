"""bashlex AST parser for the PreToolUse Bash gate (WI-6a).

This module is the L4 (AST) layer of the security gate stack. It walks the
``bashlex`` AST and emits deny findings for the categories that a pure
``permissions.allow/deny`` regex cannot represent without false-positive risk:

- Compound commands (``;``, ``&&``, ``||``, ``|``)
- Command substitution (``$(...)``, backticks)
- Process substitution (``<(...)``, ``>(...)``)
- Dangerous redirects (``/dev/tcp/*``, writes to ``/etc/``, ``~/.ssh/*``, etc.)
- Env-prefix escapes (``GIT_PAGER=...``, ``GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF=...``, ``PAGER=...``)
- Shell-out flags (``find -exec``, ``xargs sh -c``, ``git -c core.pager=``,
  ``git -c alias.X=!``)
- Direct shell invocation (``eval``, ``sh -c``, ``bash -c``, ``source``)
- Wrapper-stripping bypasses (``timeout``, ``nohup``, ``npx``, ...) that
  conceal a dangerous payload

Unknown bashlex node kinds are fail-closed: the parser emits a CRITICAL
``BASH-PARSER-UNKNOWN-NODE`` finding AND appends a JSONL entry to the audit
log so the operator can decide whether to opt the kind in via
``SPELLBOOK_BASH_PARSER_ALLOW``.

The public entry point is :func:`parse_and_check`, which returns a list of
finding dicts in the same shape produced by
:func:`spellbook.gates.rules.check_patterns`. Empty list means the parser
had no objection (later layers in ``check.py`` still run).
