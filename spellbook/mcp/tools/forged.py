    Convene roundtable and EXECUTE the dialogue locally via the worker LLM.

    Mirrors ``forge_roundtable_convene`` but performs the voice-generation
    step against the user-configured worker LLM endpoint instead of
    returning the dialogue string for orchestrator execution. The parsed
    response is returned to the caller with ``verdicts`` / ``feedback`` /
    ``dialogue`` / ``worker_llm_raw_response`` keys.

    **Loud-fail contract.** Worker errors (unreachable, timeout, malformed
    response) do NOT raise; instead the returned dict carries a
    ``worker_llm_error`` key containing a ``<worker-llm-error>`` XML block.
    The orchestrator can inspect that field and fall back to the non-local
    ``forge_roundtable_convene`` + local execution if desired.

    Requires:
        ``worker_llm_base_url``, ``worker_llm_model``,
        ``worker_llm_feature_roundtable=true``.

    Recommended model: ``qwen2.5:14b-instruct`` or larger; 7B models tend
    to ABSTAIN too frequently on multi-archetype dialogues (design §6.3).

    Args:
        feature_name: Name of the feature being developed.
