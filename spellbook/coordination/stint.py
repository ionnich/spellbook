"""Zeigarnik focus tracking: stint stack helper logic.

Provides push/pop/check/replace operations on the stint stack,
correction classification heuristics, and entry validation.

The stint stack is stored as a JSON array in a single SQLite row
per project. All read-modify-write operations use BEGIN IMMEDIATE
transactions for atomicity.

Entry schema: name, purpose, behavioral_mode, metadata, entered_at.
Old entries with extra fields (type, parent, exited_at, success_criteria)
are read fine -- Python dict access ignores extra keys.
