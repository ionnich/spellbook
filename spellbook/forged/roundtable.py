"""Roundtable MCP tools for workflow validation.

This module provides roundtable validation using tarot archetypes.
Each archetype brings a unique perspective to validate stage completion:

- Magician: Technical precision, implementation quality
- Priestess: Hidden knowledge, edge cases, what's not being said
- Hermit: Deep analysis, thorough understanding
- Fool: Naive questions, challenging assumptions
- Chariot: Forward momentum, actionable progress
- Justice: Synthesis/resolution, final arbitration
- Lovers: Integration, how pieces work together
- Hierophant: Standards, best practices, conventions
- Emperor: Constraints, boundaries, resources
- Queen: User needs, stakeholder value

Suggestions:
- [Any suggestions for improvement]

Verdict: [APPROVE | ITERATE | ABSTAIN]

## Verdict Meanings

- **APPROVE**: The artifact meets requirements for this stage
- **ITERATE**: The artifact needs revision before proceeding
- **ABSTAIN**: The archetype has no relevant input for this artifact

## Begin Roundtable

Each archetype speaks in turn. End with a summary of verdicts.
