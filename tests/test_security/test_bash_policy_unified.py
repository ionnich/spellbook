"""Tests for the unified bash policy loader.

Validates that the renamed `hooks/bash-policy.toml` file:

- Exists at the new path (and the old `gemini-policy.toml` is gone).
- Is loaded by `spellbook.gates.rules` at module import time.
- Supplemental rules from the TOML are merged into
  `DANGEROUS_BASH_PATTERNS` so the Claude path picks them up.
- A known-deny pattern from the TOML produces a finding when fed
  through `check_patterns()` against `DANGEROUS_BASH_PATTERNS`.
