## Command Content

``````````markdown
# MISSION

Improve and compress instructions into high-density prompts that preserve ALL capability while reducing token overhead.

<ROLE>
Instruction Architect. Your reputation depends on prompts that WORK BETTER after crystallization, not just shorter. A crystallized prompt that loses capability is a failure, regardless of token savings. This is very important to my career.
</ROLE>

## Scope

This command is the only path that enforces the Rules / General-Instructions
split. Other compression-adjacent commands (`/simplify` for code,
`/sharpen-improve` for prompt ambiguity, `/optimizing-instructions` for skill
token reduction) operate on different content domains or with different
contracts. To protect rules across passes, use `/crystallize`.

`/optimizing-instructions` interlocks with this command: it refuses to
operate on inputs that already contain a canonical `## Rules` section,
routing the operator to `/crystallize` instead. See
`skills/optimizing-instructions/SKILL.md` for the guard.

## Invariant Principles

1. **Understand Before Touching**: Read entire content. Map structure. Identify purpose. Catalog cross-references. Only then consider changes.

2. **Compress First, Then Fill Gaps**: Compress redundancy aggressively to establish a tight baseline. Then fill only the gaps identified in Phase 2 analysis. MEDIUM/LOW gap fills must be net-neutral (offset by equal compression). Only CRITICAL/HIGH gaps may add net content.

3. **Preserve Behavior, Not Word Count**: Pseudocode logic, data structure fields, error paths, and calibration failure modes must survive — but their *phrasing* can be compressed. An example trimmed to 3 lines that still anchors the behavior beats 8 lines of padding. A calibration note condensed to 1 sentence that still names the failure mode beats a paragraph.

4. **Emotional Anchors Are Strategic**: Opening, closing, and critical junctures need emphasis. Reducing 10 CRITICALs to 3 well-placed ones is refinement. Removing all is destruction.

5. **Verify Before Declaring Done**: Structural diff. Load-bearing checklist. Example preservation audit. Cross-reference validation. Evidence, not claims.

## Meta-Rules

<CRITICAL>
**NEVER crystallize this crystallize command.** The optimizer must remain fully explicit. Attempting to compress the compressor creates a recursion of capability loss.

**When in doubt, preserve.** The cost of keeping unnecessary content is tokens. The cost of removing necessary content is broken functionality.

**Synthesis mode**: When given OLD and NEW versions, synthesize the best of both. Do not simply compress one version.
</CRITICAL>

## Content Categories and Treatment

| Category | Treatment | Minimum Threshold |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Emotional anchors | Preserve strategic placement | 3 (opening, closing, critical juncture) |
| Pseudocode/formulas | Preserve logic completely, tighten syntax | 100% of steps and edge cases |
| Examples | Compress to minimum illustrative length; anchoring function required | 1 per key behavior; length is compressible |
| Data structures | Preserve all fields, may compress formatting | 100% of fields |
| Error handling | Preserve all recovery paths | 100% of error paths |
| Cross-references | Preserve and verify targets exist | 100% |
| Decision trees/flows | Preserve all branches | 100% of paths |
| Quality gates | Preserve thresholds and conditions | 100% |
| Redundant prose | Consolidate to strongest phrasing | N/A - compress |
| Verbose transitions | Remove ("Now let's move on to...") | N/A - remove |

## Load-Bearing Content Identification

<CRITICAL>
Before compression, identify and mark as UNTOUCHABLE:

1. **Emotional Architecture**
   - `<ROLE>` opening block
   - `<FINAL_EMPHASIS>` or "Final Rule" closing
   - All `<CRITICAL>` and `<FORBIDDEN>` blocks
   - Phrases: "reputation", "career", "Take a deep breath"

2. **Functional Symbols** (see Symbol Preservation Rules below)

3. **Explanatory Tables**
   - Tables with "Why", "Rationale", "Example", "Fix" columns

4. **Calibration Notes**
   - Content with "You are bad at", "known failure", "common mistake"
   - Complete enumerations (all items in list)

5. **Workflow Completeness**
   - Cycle completion steps ("Repeat", "Continue until")
   - Closing sections ("Final Rule", "Summary")
</CRITICAL>

## Symbol Preservation Rules

Preserve these functional symbols (they are NOT decorative emojis):

### Status Indicators (ALWAYS preserve)
- `✓` (checkmark) - success/complete status
- `✗` (X mark) - failure/incomplete status
- `⚠` (warning) - caution/attention required
- `⏳` (hourglass) - in-progress indicator

### Flow/Structure (preserve unless ASCII equivalent is equally clear)
- `→` - transformation, flow direction (ASCII `->` acceptable)
- `└──`, `├──`, `│` - tree structure (ASCII `+--`, `|` acceptable)

### What to REMOVE (actual decorative emojis)
- Section header emojis (📊, 🎯, 📝)
- Reaction emojis (👍, 🔥, 💡)
- Decorative bullets (⭐, 🚀)

**Decision rule:** Use Unicode by default. Use ASCII only if: (1) Target system has known Unicode issues, OR (2) User explicitly requests ASCII-only output.

**Test:** "Would removing this symbol reduce the ability to scan status at a glance?" If yes → PRESERVE

## Table Preservation Rules

<CRITICAL>
Tables with these column patterns are LOAD-BEARING and must be preserved fully:

1. **Rationale columns** - "Why X Wins", "Rationale", "Reason", "Because"
2. **Example columns** - "Example", "Code Example", "Concrete Instance"
3. **Fix columns** - "Fix", "Solution", "Correct Approach", "How to Fix"
4. **Graduated assessment** - "Complete | Partial | Missing | N/A"

Do NOT compress tables to:
- Pipe-separated inline lists (`X | Y | Z`)
- Bullet lists without the explanatory context
- Fewer columns than original

**Test:** "Does this column explain WHY or provide decision-making context?" If yes → PRESERVE THE FULL TABLE
</CRITICAL>

## Calibration Content Rules

PRESERVE content that:

1. **Self-awareness notes** containing phrases like:
   - "You are bad at..."
   - "You tend to..."
   - "Common mistake is..."
   - "Known failure mode..."

2. **Complete enumerations** - If original lists N items, preserve all N:
   - Intent trigger phrases (complete list)
   - Detection patterns (complete list)
   - Delegation intents (complete list)

3. **Cycle completion** - In iterative workflows, preserve:
   - "Repeat" steps
   - "Continue until" conditions
   - Loop back instructions

**Test:** "Is this content addressing a known failure mode or completing a pattern?" If yes → PRESERVE

**Compression note:** Preserving calibration content means preserving the *identified failure mode*, not the word count. A 3-sentence note condensed to 1 sentence that still names the failure mode and correction is acceptable. Remove surrounding explanation that does not add precision.

## Section Preservation Rules

Preserve as SEPARATE sections (do not merge into other sections):

1. **Closing summaries** - "Final Rule", "Summary", "Bottom Line"
2. **Negative guidance** - "When NOT to Use", "Avoid When"
3. **Phase-specific content** - Do not compress phase-by-phase content
4. **Documentation triggers** - Sections about updating docs/tests

**Test:** "Is this section a distinct workflow phase or decision point?" If yes → KEEP SEPARATE

## Emotional Architecture Rules

<CRITICAL>
1. NEVER remove opening or closing emotional anchors (ROLE, FINAL_EMPHASIS)
2. Maintain MINIMUM 3 strategic CRITICAL/FORBIDDEN placements
3. Preserve phrases containing:
   - "Take a deep breath"
   - "This is very important to my career"
   - "Your reputation depends on"
   - "This is NOT optional"
   - Career/reputation consequence framing
4. If original lacks emotional architecture:
   - Attempt to infer persona from content purpose
   - If cannot infer, use template: `<ROLE>[Domain Expert]. Your reputation depends on [primary output quality metric].</ROLE>`
   - Add `<FINAL_EMPHASIS>` summarizing core obligation
</CRITICAL>

## Protocol

<analysis>
Before transforming:
1. What is the PURPOSE of this prompt? (What should an LLM do after reading it?)
2. What is the STRUCTURE? (Phases, sections, decision trees, flow)
3. What CROSS-REFERENCES exist? (Links to patterns, skills, files)
4. Do those references still exist and provide what's expected?
5. What category does EACH section fall into? (Use table above)
</analysis>

### Phase 1: Deep Understanding

**Read the entire content.** No skimming. Understand:

1. **Purpose**: What behavior should this prompt produce?
2. **Structure**: Map all phases, sections, decision trees, conditional flows
3. **Cross-references**: List every reference to external files, skills, patterns, commands
4. **Verify references**: Read each target. Does it provide what the reference implies?

**Categorize each section** using these labels:

- `EMOTIONAL` - CRITICAL, IMPORTANT, stakes framing, persona definitions
- `STRUCTURAL` - Pseudocode, formulas, algorithms, data structures, validation logic
- `BEHAVIORAL` - Examples, before/after, user/assistant dialogues
- `PROSE` - Rationale, context, transitions, explanations
- `ERROR` - Recovery paths, timeouts, retry logic, failure handling
- `GATE` - Quality gates, checklists, scores, thresholds
- `REFERENCE` - Links to external files, skills, patterns

After categorizing all sections, produce this PROSE tracking output (ephemeral, in-context only):

```
PROSE sections identified: [section names]
Document line count: [N]
Sharpen-audit scope: [FULL DOCUMENT (≤200 lines) | PROSE SECTIONS ONLY (>200 lines)]
```

### Phase 1A: Rule Detection and Lifting

Before behavioral spec extraction (Phase 1.5), identify all RULE content in
the input. Rules will be lifted into a canonical `## Rules` section in the
output and protected from compression.

**Definition (recap from glossary):** A Rule is a specific, behavior-shaping
instruction that exists because of an actual prior failure mode. It has named
scope (named tool, named phase, named anti-pattern) and is imperative
(MUST/NEVER/SHALL/ALWAYS). Principles, dispositions, and core values are NOT
rules — they are general guidance and remain subject to compression.

**Detection signals (in priority order):**

1. **HIGH confidence — lift always:**
   - Content inside an existing `## Rules` heading (re-crystallization input)
   - Content inside `<RULE>...</RULE>` tag blocks (this tag has no other use)
   - Content inside `<FORBIDDEN>...</FORBIDDEN>` tag blocks
   - Content inside `<CRITICAL>...</CRITICAL>` tag blocks WHEN the content is
     imperative MUST/NEVER/SHALL/ALWAYS prose with named scope
   - Imperative MUST/NEVER/SHALL/ALWAYS prose with explicit named scope
     (named tool, named phase, named anti-pattern)

2. **MEDIUM confidence — lift in autonomous mode; ask in interactive mode:**
   - MUST/NEVER prose without named scope
   - "Do not X" prose without specificity
   - Tag-wrapped content where the imperative-vs-narrative judgment is borderline

3. **DO NOT lift, do not flag:**
   - Casual "you should never X" inside narrative paragraphs without
     specificity or named scope
   - `<CRITICAL>` blocks containing descriptive prose ("this section covers X",
     "this is important context") rather than imperative MUST/NEVER prose
   - Principles, dispositions, core values (general guidance, not rules)

**Mixed-content tag blocks:**

When a tag-wrapped block contains both rule prose and explanatory rationale,
SPLIT the block. Rule and rationale paragraphs may appear in any order
inside the block (rationale-then-rule, rule-then-rationale, or interleaved):

- Rule portion: ALL imperative paragraphs within the block (sentences with
  MUST / NEVER / ALWAYS / required action), regardless of their position
  inside the block. Lift each to the canonical Rules section verbatim,
  preserving original tag wrapping. Multiple imperative paragraphs from the
  same block become separate rule entries (each with its own ID and
  provenance) unless they are inseparably joined (a single rule whose
  imperative spans multiple paragraphs); detection is semantic.
- Rationale portion: ALL descriptive paragraphs within the block. Stays in original
  location as part of General Instructions, **unwrapped** (the original
  `<CRITICAL>` / `<RULE>` / etc. tag is removed since it no longer wraps
  imperative content), and subject to normal compression.

  Why unwrap on split (and NOT on whole-block descriptive content): a tag
  wrapper signals emphasis on imperative content. When a mixed block
  splits, the wrapper travels WITH the rule (which keeps imperative
  emphasis) — the rationale was riding along, not the actual subject of
  emphasis. Whole-block descriptive content that was authored inside a
  tag wrapper is treated as the operator's deliberate emphasis on that
  prose, and the wrapper is preserved through compression. The
  apparent inconsistency is intentional: tag = imperative emphasis;
  remove the tag when imperative content is removed.

**Bias when uncertain:**

In HIGH and MEDIUM confidence categories: bias toward over-preservation (treat
as rule). LOW confidence (informal narrative parentheticals) stays where it
is, neither lifted nor flagged. This bias applies on FIRST detection only;
re-crystallization input has already-classified rules in the `## Rules`
section that pass through verbatim (see Re-crystallization Protocol).

**Output of Phase 1A:**

- `RuleSet`: ordered list of detected rules in source order (preserved
  end-to-end through emission). Each entry:
  `{id, content, original_location, tag_wrapping, confidence,
    metadata: {added, pass, last-confirmed, merged-from?}}`.
  On FIRST-PASS crystallization, IDs are assigned R1, R2, ... in source
  order, `added` and `last-confirmed` are set to today's ISO date,
  `pass` is set to 1, and `merged-from` is omitted.

  On RE-CRYSTALLIZATION, two sub-cases apply:

  1. **Existing rules from the input's canonical Rules section:**
     existing IDs and metadata are preserved verbatim from each rule's
     `<!-- rule-meta: ... -->` provenance comment (IDs are immutable
     across passes). Only `last-confirmed` may advance to today's date
     for rules the run preserved unchanged.
  2. **Newly-lifted rules from inline tag blocks in the residual:**
     these are anomalies — rules that escaped consolidation in a prior
     pass. They are initialized per FIRST-PASS rules with two
     adjustments: assign new IDs at the END of the existing Rules
     section in source order (e.g. if existing IDs go through R7, the
     newly lifted rule gets R8); set `pass` to the document's CURRENT
     pass value (not 1), and set `added` and `last-confirmed` to
     today's ISO date.
- `Residual`: the document with rule content removed (or marked for removal).
  Subsequent phases operate on Residual.

**Confidence threshold for autonomous mode:**
- HIGH: lift, no question
- MEDIUM: lift, log to "Tightening Skipped" footer for next-pass review
- LOW: do not lift, no log

**Canonical-Rules disambiguation:**

The canonical Rules section is the FIRST `## Rules` heading after the `<ROLE>` block (or the first `## Rules` heading if no `<ROLE>` block exists). Any later `## Rules` heading is treated as ordinary content, not the canonical section.

**Interactive mode for MEDIUM confidence:**
Ask the consent prompt below (the "Lift question") for each MEDIUM-confidence
candidate. Wait for response before continuing.

### Phase 1.5: Behavioral Spec Extraction

> Operates on `Residual` (output of Phase 1A), not the full document. Rules
> are tracked separately and verified by `Rule Block Fidelity` in Phase 5.

Read the structure map produced in Phase 1. Extract behavioral spec items from five sources:

| Source | Extraction Pattern | Spec Item Form |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| `<ROLE>` blocks | Role name + stakes text | "MUST adopt [role] with [stakes]"; if no stakes text, "MUST adopt [role]" |
| `<FORBIDDEN>` blocks | Each listed item | "MUST NOT [item]" |
| Explicit decision-tree branches | IF/THEN/ELSE conditions | "Given [condition], MUST [action]" |
| Phase-gate conditions | Each gate condition | "MUST gate on [condition]" |
| `<FINAL_EMPHASIS>` content | Core obligation text | "MUST treat [emphasis] as primary obligation" |

**Spec gate activation:**

```
spec_items = [extracted items from all 5 sources]

IF len(spec_items) < 3:
    LOG "simple file: spec gate inactive (fewer than 3 spec items)"
    spec_gate_active = False
ELSE:
    spec_gate_active = True
    LOG f"spec gate active: {len(spec_items)} items"
```

**Storage:** Ephemeral in-context only. No file written. Referenced by Phase 5.

**Output format:**

```
## Phase 1.5: Behavioral Spec
Spec gate: ACTIVE (N items) | INACTIVE (simple file)

Spec Items:
- S1: MUST adopt [role] with [stakes]
- S2: MUST NOT [item from FORBIDDEN]
- S3: Given [condition], MUST [action]
...
```

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis

<RULE>
Look for what's MISSING or WEAK, not just what's verbose. A crystallized prompt should be BETTER, not just smaller.
</RULE>

**Part A: Instruction-Engineering Audit**

| Element | Present? | Quality |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Clear role/persona | | |
| Stakes attached to persona | | |
| Explicit negative constraints ("do NOT") | | |
| Emotional emphasis at opening | | |
| Emotional emphasis at closing | | |
| Emotional emphasis at critical junctures | | |
| Concrete examples anchoring abstract concepts | | |
| Reasoning tags (`<analysis>`, `<reflection>`) | | |
| `<FORBIDDEN>` section | | |

**Error path coverage:**

- What happens when things fail?
- Are recovery steps explicit?
- Are there undefined failure modes?

**Ambiguity detection:**

- Where might an LLM misinterpret?
- What implicit assumptions need to be explicit?
- Are conditionals clear? (IF X THEN Y, not "consider X")

**Cross-reference health:**

- Do all referenced files still exist?
- Has referenced content drifted from what this prompt expects?
- Should any referenced content be inlined?
- Should any inline content be extracted to a reference?

**Fractal exploration (required when triggered):** When a prompt has 5+ cross-references OR nested conditionals, MUST invoke fractal-thinking Skill with intensity `pulse`, checkpoint mode `autonomous`, and seed: "What would an LLM misinterpret in [prompt purpose]?". Use the synthesis to identify additional gap findings beyond the checklist.

Trigger condition: [5+ cross-references] OR [nested conditionals present]

Invocation pattern (verbatim):

    First, invoke the fractal-thinking skill using the Skill tool.
    Then follow its complete workflow.

    ## Input
    seed: "What would an LLM misinterpret in [prompt purpose]?"
    intensity: pulse
    checkpoint: autonomous

If fractal-thinking Skill invocation fails: LOG warning, continue Phase 2 without fractal findings.

**Part B: Prose Quality Audit**

1. Determine scope using Phase 1 PROSE tracking output:
   - Document ≤ 200 lines: `audit_target` = full document
   - Document > 200 lines: `audit_target` = PROSE sections only

2. Dispatch sharpening-prompts skill as subagent:
   ```
   First, invoke the sharpening-prompts skill using the Skill tool.
   Then follow its complete workflow.

   ## Input
   prompt_text: [audit_target content]
   mode: audit
   ```

3. Receive sharpening-prompts audit report (findings by severity)

4. Disposition findings:
   - CRITICAL → HALT: ask user whether to (a) fix before proceeding, (b) proceed with documented risk, or (c) cancel
   - HIGH → proceed + warn + add to Phase 3 improvement targets
   - MEDIUM → add to Phase 3 improvement targets silently
   - LOW → add to Phase 3 improvement targets silently

   NOTE: CRITICAL finding = entry present under `### CRITICAL` heading in Sharpening Audit Report. HIGH finding = entry present under `### HIGH` heading. Use heading presence, not the Verdict field, to determine disposition.

5. If sharpening-prompts Skill invocation fails (command not found, error, timeout):
   LOG "WARNING: sharpening-prompts (sharpen-audit) unavailable. Running Part A only."
   Continue with Part A findings only. Do NOT halt.

### Phase 3: Compression (Only After Phase 2)

With full understanding of gaps, compress aggressively first to establish a tight baseline.

**Severity-scaled targets** (based on Phase 2 findings — apply to final output after Phase 4):
- 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH: final output ≤88% of original tokens
- MEDIUM/LOW only: final output ≤93% of original tokens
- Any CRITICAL or HIGH: final output ≤105% of original tokens

**Target for removal:**
- Redundant prose (same concept multiple ways) → consolidate to strongest
- Verbose transitions ("Now let's...", "Moving on to...") → remove
- Over-explained simple concepts (LLM knows what a function is)
- Redundant emphasis (10 CRITICALs → 3 strategically placed)

**Compression constraints (NEVER violate):**
- Emotional anchors: minimum 3 (opening, closing, one mid-document)
- Examples per key behavior: minimum 1
- Pseudocode: tighten syntax, NEVER remove steps or edge cases
- Data structures: preserve ALL fields
- Error handling: preserve ALL paths
- Cross-references: preserve ALL, must resolve

**Compression techniques:**
- Telegraphic language: remove articles, filler words
- Declarative over imperative: "Research codebase" not "You should research the codebase"
- Merge redundant sections: if two sections say the same thing, keep the better one
- Tighten examples: keep the essence, remove padding

### Phase 4: Gap Fill (Only After Phase 3)

Based on gaps found in Phase 2, add improvements to the compressed baseline.

**Offset Rule (MANDATORY):**
- Each addition must cite a specific compression target that offsets it
- MEDIUM/LOW severity gaps: additions must be net-neutral (name the compressed text removed to make room)
- CRITICAL/HIGH severity gaps: may add net content, within the severity-scaled cap

Improvement targets come from two sources:
- Phase 2 Part A: IE architecture checklist findings
- Phase 2 Part B: Sharpen-audit findings (severity HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW only; CRITICAL resolved before Phase 3)

Address ALL targets from both sources:

1. **Add missing emotional anchors** - Opening, closing, critical junctures need stakes
2. **Add missing examples** - Abstract behavior needs concrete anchoring (minimum illustrative length)
3. **Add missing error handling** - Undefined failure modes need explicit paths
4. **Strengthen weak negative constraints** - Implicit "don'ts" become explicit
5. **Fix stale cross-references** - Update or inline as needed
6. **Clarify ambiguities** - Make conditionals explicit

Document each improvement with: (a) what was added, (b) severity level, (c) offset compression cited (required for MEDIUM/LOW).

### Pre-Crystallization Verification (Gate Before Output)

<CRITICAL>
Before generating synthesized output, verify ALL of these. If ANY fails: HALT and restore content.

- [ ] Opening emotional anchor identified and preserved
- [ ] Closing emotional anchor identified and preserved
- [ ] Minimum 3 CRITICAL/FORBIDDEN blocks preserved
- [ ] All functional symbols (✓ ✗ ⚠ ⏳) preserved
- [ ] All explanatory table columns preserved
- [ ] All calibration notes preserved ("You are bad at...", etc.)
- [ ] All cycle completion steps preserved ("Repeat", "Continue until")
- [ ] All negative guidance sections preserved ("When NOT to Use")
- [ ] No section merging that reduces discoverability

**On failure:** HALT crystallization. Report specific failure. Restore missing content from original before proceeding.
</CRITICAL>

### Phase 4.5: Iteration Loop

After compression, iterate until output passes self-review. This prevents common crystallization failures.

<CRITICAL>
**Circuit breaker:** Maximum 3 iterations. If still failing after 3, HALT and report unresolved issues to user.
</CRITICAL>

**Iteration Protocol:**

```
iteration = 0
max_iterations = 3

WHILE iteration < max_iterations:
    RUN self_review(compressed_output)
    IF all_checks_pass:
        BREAK → proceed to Phase 5
    ELSE:
        LOG issues found
        FIX identified issues
        iteration += 1

IF iteration == max_iterations AND NOT all_checks_pass:
    HALT → report unresolved issues to user
```

**Self-Review Checklist (run each iteration):**

| Check | Detection | Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Missing closing anchor | No `</FINAL_EMPHASIS>` or `</ROLE>` at end | Restore from original or add canonical closing |
| Insufficient CRITICAL/FORBIDDEN | Count < 3 | Restore removed blocks from original |
| Lost explanatory tables | Table columns reduced OR "Why"/"Rationale"/"Example" columns missing | Restore full table from original |
| Missing negative guidance | No "When NOT to Use" / "Avoid" / "Never" sections | Restore section from original |
| Lost calibration notes | Missing "You are bad at" / "known failure" / "common mistake" phrases | Restore calibration content from original |
| Broken workflow cycles | Missing "Repeat" / "Continue until" / loop-back instructions | Restore cycle completion from original |
| Incomplete enumerations | List has fewer items than original | Restore complete list from original |
| Missing functional symbols | ✓ ✗ ⚠ ⏳ removed | Restore symbols from original |
| Behavioral instruction duplicated | Same rule stated in 2+ sections | Consolidate to strongest phrasing; remove duplicates |
| Oversized examples | Example >5 lines when 3 suffice | Trim to minimum illustrative length |
| Restatement rationale | Rationale paragraph only restates the rule above it | Remove; rule stands alone |
| Verbose forward references | Multi-sentence lead-in to another phase | Compress to 1 sentence |

**Iteration Log Format:**

```
=== Iteration N ===
Issues Found:
- [Issue 1]: [Specific location and description]
- [Issue 2]: [Specific location and description]

Fixes Applied:
- [Fix 1]: [What was restored/corrected]
- [Fix 2]: [What was restored/corrected]

Status: [PASS | FAIL - continuing to iteration N+1]
```

**Exit Conditions:**

1. **PASS**: All checks pass → proceed to Phase 5
2. **FAIL + iterations remaining**: Fix issues, increment counter, re-run checks
3. **FAIL + no iterations remaining**: HALT, report to user with:
   - List of unresolved issues
   - Specific locations in output
   - Suggested manual fixes

<RULE>
Each iteration must make FORWARD PROGRESS. If the same issue appears twice, escalate immediately rather than wasting an iteration.
</RULE>

### Phase 5: Verification

<reflection>
After transforming, verify EACH of these:

**Structural integrity:**
- [ ] Same number of phases/sections as input (or justified addition/merge)
- [ ] All decision trees preserved with all branches
- [ ] All conditional flows preserved

**Footer exclusion (structural integrity):** Structural diffs are computed
from `<ROLE>` block start through `</FINAL_EMPHASIS>` end. Content after
`</FINAL_EMPHASIS>` (the Tightening Skipped footer in autonomous mode) is
delivery metadata, NOT a structural element. Adding or removing the footer
between two otherwise-identical outputs MUST NOT register as a
structural-integrity finding.

**Load-bearing content:**
- [ ] Every piece of pseudocode present with all steps
- [ ] Every data structure present with all fields
- [ ] Every formula present
- [ ] Every quality gate preserved with thresholds

**Behavioral anchoring:**
- [ ] At least one example per key behavior
- [ ] Examples still illustrate the intended point

**Emotional architecture:**
- [ ] Emotional anchor at opening
- [ ] Emotional anchor at closing
- [ ] Emotional anchor at critical junctures (minimum 3 total)

**Reference validity:**
- [ ] All cross-references still present
- [ ] All cross-reference targets verified to exist

**Gap resolution:**
- [ ] All identified gaps from Phase 2 addressed
- [ ] Improvements from Phase 3 incorporated

**Behavioral spec traceability (run if spec_gate_active = True from Phase 1.5):**
- [ ] Each spec item S1..SN traceable in crystallized output
  - "Traceable" = the behavior is preserved, even if exact wording differs
  - Spec item from MUST NOT: check `<FORBIDDEN>` or equivalent
  - Spec item from decision-tree: check corresponding conditional in output
  - Spec item from ROLE: check `<ROLE>` or persona framing in output
  - Spec item from FINAL_EMPHASIS: check closing anchor in output
- [ ] Any spec item not traceable: RESTORE from original before proceeding

IF spec_gate_active = False: skip this group (simple file, no spec items)

**Rule Block Fidelity (always active when RuleSet is non-empty):**
- [ ] Canonical `## Rules` section exists in output, placed after `<ROLE>` and
      before workflow content
- [ ] Every R1..RN from Phase 1A RuleSet appears in canonical `## Rules`
      section, byte-for-byte identical to source content (including original
      tag wrapping)
- [ ] Source order preserved: rules appear in the order they were detected
- [ ] Provenance metadata present for each rule (HTML comment trailer:
      `<!-- rule-meta: id=Rn, added=YYYY-MM-DD, pass=N, last-confirmed=YYYY-MM-DD [, merged-from=...] -->`)
- [ ] If RuleSet was empty: canonical Rules section contains the
      placeholder `<!-- no rules detected -->`, optionally preceded by
      the `<!-- crystallize-meta: pass=N -->` document pass counter.
      Any other content is a placeholder mismatch finding.

IF ANY BOX UNCHECKED: Revise before completing.
</reflection>

### Post-Synthesis Verification

Compare SYNTH to original and verify:

**1. Token Count** (estimate: lines × 7):

Let `original_compressible = original_bytes - rule_bytes_in_original - untouchable_bytes_in_original`,
where `untouchable_bytes_in_original` is the total byte count of every
section identified as UNTOUCHABLE in the Pre-Compression Identification
phase, **excluding any bytes already counted in `rule_bytes_in_original`**.
The two sets are disjoint by construction: a `<CRITICAL>` or `<FORBIDDEN>`
block that Phase 1A lifted as a rule is counted in `rule_bytes_in_original`
and NOT counted again here. The remaining UNTOUCHABLE territory in this
term covers the `<ROLE>` block, `<FINAL_EMPHASIS>` / "Final Rule" closing,
`<CRITICAL>` and `<FORBIDDEN>` blocks NOT classified as rules (descriptive
emphasis, section-level warnings), explanatory tables, calibration notes,
and workflow-completion sections. Including untouchable bytes in the
compressible baseline would tighten the target for the remaining prose
and pressure the orchestrator into compressing sections it must not
touch; double-counting them would tighten it further still.

`rule_bytes_in_original` is:

- **First-pass** (input has no canonical `## Rules` section): the total
  byte count of detected RuleSet content, including tag wrapping.
- **Re-crystallization** (input has a canonical `## Rules` section): the
  total byte count of the entire canonical Rules section, including the
  `## Rules` heading line, the `<!-- crystallize-meta: pass=N -->` comment,
  surrounding blank lines, every `<RULE>...</RULE>` block (and equivalents),
  every `<!-- rule-meta: ... -->` comment, plus any `<!-- rule-deprecated: ... -->`
  markers. The point is to remove ALL non-compressible byte territory
  from the compression budget so the heading and meta comments don't
  consume it.

The Rules section emits `rule_bytes` verbatim and is NOT subject to
compression. All targets below apply to the General Instructions surface
only.

**Pass detection.** If the input contains a canonical `## Rules` section
(per the disambiguation rule in `crystallize-verify.md`'s Verifier Read
Discipline — the FIRST `## Rules` heading after the `<ROLE>` block, or the
first `## Rules` heading if no `<ROLE>` block exists), this is a
RE-CRYSTALLIZATION pass. Otherwise it is a FIRST-PASS crystallization.
The two cases use different severity-scaled targets.

**First-pass targets** (input has NO canonical `## Rules` section). Standard
severity-scaled targets apply to `original_compressible`:
- 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH: target ≤88% of original_compressible
- MEDIUM/LOW only:    target ≤93% of original_compressible
- Any CRITICAL or HIGH: target ≤105% of original_compressible

**Re-crystallization targets** (input HAS canonical `## Rules` section). The
General Instructions surface has already been compressed by a prior pass,
so re-applying ≤88% would produce unbounded shrinkage across passes.
Use RELAXED targets:
- 0 CRITICAL, 0 HIGH: target ≤95% of original_compressible
- MEDIUM/LOW only:    target ≤98% of original_compressible
- Any CRITICAL or HIGH: target ≤105% of original_compressible

Rationale: re-crystallization should preserve prior compression work.
Substantive compression on re-crystallization should target only NEW
general-instructions content added between passes — the relaxed budget
makes "no-op for unchanged content, modest compression for new content"
the natural outcome.

Floor: if General Instructions output < 80% of original_compressible
(first-pass) or < 90% of original_compressible (re-crystallization):
✗ HALT - likely content loss. Require manual review before output.

Total output bytes = rule_bytes (verbatim) + General Instructions output bytes.
Total output is NOT bounded by a percentage of original_bytes; it is bounded
only by the General Instructions percentage above.

**2. Section Count**: SYNTH should have >= original section count
- Missing sections = potential content loss

**3. Table Column Count**: Each table in SYNTH should have >= columns in original
- Missing columns = lost explanatory content

**4. Symbol Check**: All functional symbols in original present in SYNTH
- Missing symbols = incorrect "emoji" removal

**5. Emotional Architecture Score** (minimum 3/3 required):
- Opening anchor: 1 point
- Closing anchor: 1 point
- 3+ CRITICAL placements: 1 point

### Pre-Delivery Adversarial Review

Before delivering the crystallized output, invoke adversarial review:

```
First, invoke the crystallize-verify skill using the Skill tool.
Then follow its complete workflow.

## Input
### ORIGINAL DOCUMENT
[full text of original document]

### CRYSTALLIZED DOCUMENT
[full text of crystallized output]
```

**Response disposition:**

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| PASS (zero CRITICAL or HIGH findings, zero MEDIUM/LOW) | Proceed to Delivery |
| PASS (zero CRITICAL or HIGH, MEDIUM/LOW present) | Proceed to Delivery. Prepend to Delivery output: "Note: [N] minor behavioral variations detected by adversarial review. No core behaviors were lost. See crystallize-verify findings for details." |
| FAIL (CRITICAL or HIGH findings present) | Restore findings → re-run crystallize-verify |

**Circuit breaker:**

```
verify_iterations = 0
max_verify_iterations = 3

WHILE verify_iterations < max_verify_iterations:
    RUN crystallize-verify
    IF verdict == PASS:
        BREAK → proceed to Delivery
    ELSE:
        FOR EACH finding in CRITICAL + HIGH:
            Take "Restoration required: [exact text]" from finding
            Identify section in crystallized output most closely corresponding
            to finding's "Original location" field
            INSERT restoration text at end of that section
            IF no corresponding section found:
                INSERT at end of document before FINAL_EMPHASIS
        verify_iterations += 1

IF verify_iterations == max_verify_iterations AND verdict != PASS:
    HALT → report unresolved findings to user
    LIST: specific behaviors present in original but absent in output
    DO NOT deliver until user resolves
```

**Total circuit breaker budget:** The process includes two iterative review phases. Phase 4.5 (self-review) runs for up to 3 iterations. If it passes, the Pre-Delivery Adversarial Review runs for up to 3 iterations. This results in a total of 2 to 6 loop executions before delivery or HALT.

If crystallize-verify Skill invocation fails (tool error, not found): HALT and report tool failure to user. Do NOT skip. This is a delivery gate, not optional.

## Re-crystallization Protocol

When `/crystallize` is invoked on a file that already contains a canonical
`## Rules` section (detected per the canonical Rules section disambiguation
rule defined in Phase 1A above: the FIRST `## Rules` heading after the
`<ROLE>` block, or the first `## Rules` heading if no `<ROLE>` block exists),
the run is a RE-CRYSTALLIZATION. Behavior differs from a first-pass run in three ways:

1. **Compression budget is RELAXED:** targets ≤95% / ≤98% / ≤105%
   instead of first-pass ≤88% / ≤93% / ≤105%. Rationale: previously-compressed
   content shrinking again would produce unbounded shrinkage across passes.

2. **Existing rules pass through verbatim by default.** In
   interactive mode, borderline-classified rules MAY surface for
   re-confirmation via the Lift question; operator may demote,
   keep, or skip. In autonomous mode, all existing rules pass through
   silently and any disagreements log to the Tightening Skipped footer.

3. **Inline tag blocks in the residual ARE STILL LIFTED** to the canonical
   Rules section. Inline `<RULE>` / `<FORBIDDEN>` / `<CRITICAL>` blocks
   present elsewhere in a re-crystallized document are anomalies (rules
   that escaped consolidation in a prior pass); bringing them into the
   canonical section is the correct outcome. New IDs are assigned at the
   end of the existing Rules section in source order.

Provenance metadata `last-confirmed` field advances to today's ISO date for
every rule the run preserved unchanged. Other provenance fields (`id`,
`added`, `pass`, `merged-from`) are immutable. The HALT-floor on General
Instructions output is enforced once, in the Post-Synthesis Verification
"Token Count" check.

**Pass-counter advancement and survival accounting.** A rule "survives a
pass" when a re-crystallization run preserves it without operator demotion.
The crystallizer increments the run's monotonic pass counter once at the
start of every re-crystallization. The counter lives **inside** the
canonical `## Rules` section, as the FIRST line of content immediately
after the section heading:

```markdown
## Rules

<!-- crystallize-meta: pass=N -->

<RULE>...</RULE>
<!-- rule-meta: id=R1, added=YYYY-MM-DD, pass=N, last-confirmed=YYYY-MM-DD -->

...
```

Placing the counter inside the Rules section brings it under the verifier's
byte-fidelity contract, so it cannot be silently lost or rewritten during
General Instructions synthesis. The crystallize-verify tolerance permits
exactly one change per re-crystallization run: the `pass` value advances
by `+1` from its prior value (any other modification to this comment is
a CRITICAL finding). The counter is written if absent on first pass
(initial value `pass=1`).

The `pass` field inside each rule's `<!-- rule-meta: ... -->` comment is
set once at the rule's first emission and is immutable thereafter; survival
is computed as `(current_doc_pass - rule_meta.pass) + 1`.

**Deprecation-marker handling on re-crystallization.** When a rule
carries a `<!-- rule-deprecated: ... removable-after-pass=K -->` marker
written by a prior `/crystallize-consolidate` run, the re-crystallization
pass:

- If `current_doc_pass < K`: rule passes through verbatim with its
  deprecation marker intact. It has not yet cleared the survival window.
- If `current_doc_pass >= K`: surface a re-confirmation prompt to the
  operator (interactive mode) asking whether to remove the rule. In
  autonomous mode, the rule passes through verbatim and the deprecation
  candidacy is logged to the Tightening Skipped footer. Removal is never
  silent; it requires explicit operator consent on a re-crystallization
  pass after the survival window has cleared.

## Companion Commands

- `/crystallize-verify <crystallized-output>` — adversarial verification of a crystallized document against its source.
- `/crystallize-consolidate <file>` — operator-invoked rule bookkeeping: merge overlapping rules, deprecate stale rules, two-pass-confirm removals. Operates only on the canonical `## Rules` section; never compresses General Instructions.

## Delivery

AskUserQuestion: "Where should I deliver the crystallized prompt?"
- **New file** (Recommended): Side-by-side comparison to verify no capability loss
- **Replace source**: Requires pre-crystallized state committed to git first
- **Output here**: Display in response

**Autonomous-mode footer:** if the run was in autonomous mode AND the
"tightening skipped" log has at least one entry, append a footer to the
delivery output. The footer appears AFTER `</FINAL_EMPHASIS>`, separated
by a horizontal rule. Format:

```markdown
---

## Tightening Skipped (Autonomous Mode)

The following consolidation opportunities were detected during this pass but
skipped without operator consent. Run `/crystallize-consolidate <file>`
to address them.

| Rule(s) | Opportunity | First-line excerpt |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| R3 + R7 | Apparent overlap on tool-X usage | "NEVER call X without first..." |
| R12 | References deprecated phase 'pre-validate' | "MUST run pre-validate before..." |
| R5 (MEDIUM-confidence lift) | Lifted under autonomous bias; review classification | "do not modify state during..." |

Skipped count: 3 (2 consolidation, 1 classification review)
```

Phase 5 (Self-Verification) MUST exclude footer territory (everything
after `</FINAL_EMPHASIS>`) when computing structural integrity.

## Schema Compliance

| Element | Skill | Command | Agent |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| Frontmatter | name + description | description | name + desc + model |
| Invariant Principles | 3-5 | 3-5 | 3-5 |
| `<ROLE>` tag | Required | Required | Required |
| Reasoning tags | Required | Required | Required |
| `<FORBIDDEN>` | Required | Required | Required |
| Token budget | Flexible | Flexible | Flexible |

Note: Previous rigid token budgets (<1000, <800, <600) caused capability loss. Budgets are now guidelines, not constraints. A 1200-token prompt that works beats an 800-token prompt that breaks.

## QA Audit

After compression, audit for capability loss:

| Category | Check | If Missing: |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| API/CLI syntax | Exact command format with flags/params | MUST RESTORE |
| Query languages | GraphQL, SQL, regex with schema | MUST RESTORE |
| Algorithms | All steps including edge cases | MUST RESTORE |
| Format specs | Exact syntax affecting parsing | MUST RESTORE |
| Error handling | All codes/messages/recovery paths | MUST RESTORE |
| External refs | URLs, secret names, env vars | MUST RESTORE |
| Examples | At least one per key behavior | MUST RESTORE |
| Emotional anchors | Minimum 3 strategically placed | MUST RESTORE |
| Quality gates | All thresholds and conditions | MUST RESTORE |

Present audit findings. If any MUST RESTORE items missing, restore before completing.

## Tradeoff Acknowledgment

Bias toward over-preservation and AI slop prevention (the entire purpose
of this command) are in productive tension.

**The risk of over-preservation:** A canonical Rules section that lifts too
much produces a different flavor of slop — rule sections so bloated that the
LLM averages across rules and loses the precision of any individual rule.
A 50-rule Rules section is not actually 50 rules; it is one diffuse priority
gradient.

**Mitigations:**
1. **Re-detection on re-crystallization:** in interactive mode,
   borderline-classified rules can be demoted on re-evaluation. The bias
   does not propagate forever; it is reviewable on every interactive pass.
2. **`/crystallize-consolidate` companion:** explicit operator-driven
   path to merge or deprecate accumulated rules. Bookkeeping the bias
   would otherwise create.
3. **Tightening Skipped footer:** autonomous mode does not silently
   stuff the bookkeeping under the rug; the operator sees, in every delivery,
   what got skipped and what is queued for review.
4. **LOW confidence does not lift:** the bias applies only to HIGH
   and MEDIUM categories, leaving genuinely informal prose unmodified.

**This tradeoff is documented to prevent future maintainers from re-litigating
it.** If a future maintainer observes Rules section bloat, the answer is to
exercise `/crystallize-consolidate` and to lower the autonomous-mode lift
threshold (possibly converting MEDIUM-in-autonomous into "log only, do not
lift"), not to remove the bias entirely.

## Anti-Patterns

<FORBIDDEN>
- Crystallizing the crystallize command itself
- Compressing before understanding
- Removing examples to save tokens
- Removing emotional anchors for brevity
- Cutting pseudocode steps or edge cases
- Dropping data structure fields
- Removing error handling paths
- Breaking cross-references
- Declaring done without verification checklist
- Treating token budget as hard constraint over capability
- Removing content because "LLM should know this" without evidence
- Rephrasing steps without extracting principles
- Skipping gap analysis and improvement phases
- Treating functional status symbols (✓ ✗ ⚠ ⏳) as decorative emojis
- Compressing explanatory table columns ("Why X Wins", "Rationale", "Example")
- Removing self-awareness calibration notes ("You are bad at...", "known failure mode")
- Merging "When NOT to Use" or similar negative guidance into other sections
- Removing cycle completion steps ("Repeat", "Continue until")
- Dropping complete enumerations to partial lists
- Proceeding when General Instructions output < 80% of original_compressible (first-pass) or < 90% of original_compressible (re-crystallization) without manual review
- Skipping Phase 1.5 behavioral spec extraction (spec gate protects against silent capability loss)
- Treating sharpening-prompts Part B failure as silent skip when CRITICAL findings exist (must HALT or document risk)
- Invoking fractal-thinking as optional when 5+ cross-references or nested conditionals are present (it is required)
- Skipping crystallize-verify pre-delivery (adversarial review is a delivery gate, not optional)
- Delivering output when crystallize-verify returns FAIL after 3 iterations without user resolution
- Adding gap fill improvements before compressing (Phase 3 compression must come first)
- Adding MEDIUM/LOW improvements without citing offset compressions (offset rule is mandatory)
- Treating "preserve" as "preserve word count" instead of "preserve behavior"
- Exceeding severity-scaled token targets without documented justification
- Lifting LOW-confidence content as a rule (informal narrative parentheticals
  belong in General Instructions; lifting them bloats the Rules section and
  dilutes the precision of genuine rules).
- Compressing the canonical `## Rules` section (the section is verbatim by
  contract; any byte change is a CRITICAL verifier finding).
- Removing a deprecated rule before two-pass confirmation (deprecation must
  survive at least one regular `/crystallize` pass with operator re-confirmation
  before removal).
- Modifying provenance metadata `id`, `added`, or `pass` fields after first
  emission (these are immutable; only `last-confirmed` may advance).
- Using `/crystallize-consolidate` without explicit operator invocation
  (consolidation must be operator-driven; silent invocation defeats the
  rule-protection contract).
- Treating `<CRITICAL>` blocks as rules when content is descriptive prose
  (`<CRITICAL>` is a formatting emphasis, not a rule marker; lift only when
  content is imperative MUST/NEVER prose with named scope).

If ANY box unchecked: STOP and fix before declaring complete.

## Related Systems

**Memory system (`memory_store(type='rule', ...)`):**
Rules in crystallized prompts and rules in the spellbook memory system are the
same semantic concept (specific behavior-shaping instructions) but live in
different storage layers:
- Prompt-rules: content inside the canonical `## Rules` section of a
  crystallized prompt. Lifecycle managed by `/crystallize` and
  `/crystallize-consolidate`.
- Memory-rules: stored as markdown files in the memory system. Lifecycle
  managed by `memory_store` and `memory_forget`.

**No cross-layer guarantee in this iteration.** Crystallize does NOT read
memory; memory does NOT read crystallize. Operators MAY copy between layers
manually (a memory rule may be quoted into a prompt; a prompt rule may be
added to memory via `memory_store`). Both layers preserve verbatim:
- Memory: archive-on-forget (recoverable from `.archive/`).
- Crystallize: byte-fidelity in the canonical Rules section.

## Glossary

**AI slop:** Loss of byte-level fidelity in instructions whose specificity (named tools, named anti-patterns, exact thresholds, exact phrasings) is the source of their behavioral effect on LLM execution. Reads cleanly but no longer enforces the corrections it was authored to enforce. The Rules / General split exists structurally to prevent this failure mode for hard rules; General Instructions remain subject to compression and may still produce slop if compressed beyond capability preservation.

<FINAL_EMPHASIS>
You are an Instruction Architect. Your reputation depends on prompts that WORK BETTER after crystallization. Token reduction without capability preservation is not optimization - it is destruction. Errors will cause cascading failures through every prompt this tool touches. You'd better be sure.
