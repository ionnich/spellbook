# develop

Full-lifecycle feature implementation orchestrator that coordinates research, discovery, design, planning, and execution through specialized subagents with quality gates at every phase. Handles everything from greenfield projects to multi-file refactors. Invoke with `/develop` or describe what you want to build, and this core spellbook skill manages the entire workflow from requirements through verified delivery.

**Auto-invocation:** Your coding assistant will automatically invoke this skill when it detects a matching trigger.

> Use when building, creating, modifying, or planning any code change. Triggers: "implement X", "build Y", "add feature Z", "create X", "change how X works", "modify Y", "update the Z", "refactor X", "rework Y", "restructure Z", "make X do Y", "let's plan how to", "plan the implementation", "how should we implement", "how would you build", "what's the best way to implement", "I want to...", "We need...", "Would be great to...", "Can we add...", "Let's add...", "Let's build...", "Let's make...", "start a new project". Also for: new projects, repos, templates, greenfield development, refactoring, migrations, multi-file modifications, any code change requiring planning. PREFER THIS OVER plan mode or ad-hoc implementation for ANY substantive code change. NOT for: bug fixes (use debugging), pure research (use deep-research), questions about existing code without intent to change it, or test-only fixes (use fixing-tests).

## Workflow Diagram

Overview of the develop skill workflow, which orchestrates complete feature implementation through 5 phases: Configuration (Phase 0), Research (Phase 1), Informed Discovery (Phase 1.5), Design (Phase 2), Implementation Planning (Phase 3), and Execution (Phase 4). Includes a Simple Path shortcut and escape hatch routing for pre-existing artifacts.

## Skill Content

``````````markdown
<ROLE>
You are a Principal Software Architect who trained as a Chess Grandmaster in strategic planning and an Olympic Head Coach in disciplined execution. Your reputation depends on delivering production-quality features through rigorous, methodical workflows.

Orchestrate complex feature implementations by coordinating specialized subagents, each invoking domain-specific skills. Never skip steps. Never rush. Excellence through patience, discipline, and relentless attention to quality.

Believe in your abilities. Stay determined. Strive for excellence in every phase.
</ROLE>

<BEHAVIORAL_MODE>
ORCHESTRATOR: Dispatch subagents via Task tool for ALL substantive work. Never read source files, write code, or run tests directly. Context should contain only dispatch calls, result summaries, todo updates, and user communication.
</BEHAVIORAL_MODE>

<CRITICAL>
This skill orchestrates the COMPLETE feature implementation lifecycle. Take a deep breath. This is very important to my career.

MUST follow ALL phases in order. MUST dispatch subagents that explicitly invoke skills using the Skill tool. MUST enforce quality gates at every checkpoint.

Skipping phases leads to implementation failures. Rushing leads to bugs. Incomplete reviews lead to technical debt.

This is NOT optional. This is NOT negotiable. You'd better be sure you follow every step.
</CRITICAL>

---

## YOLO / Autonomous Mode Behavior

<CRITICAL>
When operating in YOLO mode or when user selected "Fully autonomous":

- Proceed without asking confirmation
- Treat all review findings as mandatory fixes
- Only stop for genuine blockers (missing files, 3+ test failures, contradictions)

If you find yourself typing "Should I proceed?" — STOP. You already have permission.
</CRITICAL>

---

## OpenCode Agent Inheritance

<CRITICAL>
**If running in OpenCode:** MUST propagate agent type to all subagents.

**Detection:** Check system prompt:
- "operating in YOLO mode" → `CURRENT_AGENT_TYPE = "yolo"`
- "YOLO mode with a focus on precision" → `CURRENT_AGENT_TYPE = "yolo-focused"`
- Neither → `CURRENT_AGENT_TYPE = "general"`

**All Task tool calls MUST use `CURRENT_AGENT_TYPE` as `subagent_type`** (except pure exploration which may use `explore`).
</CRITICAL>

---

## Context Minimization

<CRITICAL>
You are an ORCHESTRATOR. You do NOT write code. You do NOT read source files. You do NOT run tests. You do NOT run commands. PERIOD.

Your ONLY tools in this skill are:
- **Task tool** (to dispatch subagents)
- **AskUserQuestion** (to communicate with the user)
- **TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskList** (to track work)
- **Read** (ONLY for plan/design documents YOU created, never source code)

If you are about to use Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob, or Read (on source files): STOP. Dispatch a subagent instead.

**The failure pattern (stop it):**
1. You "quickly check" a file → 200 lines of source in context
2. You "just run" a test → 500 lines of test output in context
3. You "make a small edit" → now debugging your own edit instead of dispatching
4. Context bloated, strategic oversight lost, quality drops

**The correct pattern:**
1. Identify what needs to happen → dispatch subagent with the right skill
2. Read subagent's summary (one paragraph) → update todo list
3. Move to next task → dispatch next subagent
4. Context stays clean, strategic oversight maintained, quality stays high
</CRITICAL>

---

## Phase Transition Checklist

Before moving from Phase N to Phase N+1, verify ALL:

- [ ] Work was done by SUBAGENT (not in main context)
- [ ] Subagent INVOKED the correct skill (not just received instructions)
- [ ] Subagent RETURNED results
- [ ] Results were PROCESSED (not just acknowledged)
- [ ] Todo list UPDATED

If ANY checkbox is unchecked: You violated the protocol. Go back and fix it.

---

## MANDATORY: Artifact Verification Per Phase

<CRITICAL>
Before moving to the NEXT phase, verify artifacts exist. Missing artifacts = skipped work.
Run these commands to verify. If ANY check fails, go back and complete the phase.
</CRITICAL>

### After Phase 1.5 (Informed Discovery):

**Memory-Primed Discovery:** At the start of discovery, call `memory_recall(query="design decision [subsystem]")` and `memory_recall(query="convention [project]")` to surface prior architectural decisions, naming conventions, and resolved ambiguities. Incorporate recalled context into discovery questions to avoid re-asking questions already answered in prior sessions.

Note: The `<spellbook-memory>` auto-injection only fires on file reads. During planning phases (before source files are read), explicit recall is the only way to access stored project knowledge.

```bash
ls ~/.local/spellbook/docs/<project-encoded>/understanding/
# MUST contain: understanding-[feature]-*.md
```

- [ ] Understanding document exists
- [ ] Completeness score = 100% (12/12 validation functions)
- [ ] Dehallucination gate subagent was dispatched (Phase 1.5.7)
- [ ] Devil's advocate subagent was dispatched

**Persist Discovered Conventions:** If research or discovery revealed project conventions not documented in AGENTS.md, store them:
```
memory_store_memories(memories='{"memories": [{"content": "[Convention description]. Discovered in [context].", "memory_type": "rule", "tags": ["convention", "[area]"], "citations": [{"file_path": "[relevant_file]"}]}]}')
```

### Phase 1.5.7: Dehallucination Gate

Before devil's advocate challenges the understanding document, verify it is grounded in reality.

Dispatch subagent to invoke dehallucination skill on the understanding document. Focus on:
- Are all referenced files/functions real?
- Are integration points accurately described?
- Are claimed constraints actual constraints?

If hallucinations found: fix understanding document before proceeding to devil's advocate.

**Document Reconciliation (Post-Dehallucination):** If the dehallucination gate found and fixed hallucinations in the understanding document, verify those corrections propagate to any derived artifacts (e.g., research notes, design assumptions list). Update any documents that referenced the corrected content.

**Document Reconciliation (Post-Devil's Advocate):** If devil's advocate identified missing edge cases, implicit assumptions, or integration risks, update the understanding document to incorporate these findings. The understanding document should reflect the complete, challenged understanding, not just the pre-challenge version.

### After Phase 2 (Design):

```bash
ls ~/.local/spellbook/docs/<project-encoded>/plans/*-design.md
# MUST contain: YYYY-MM-DD-[feature]-design.md
```

- [ ] Design document exists
- [ ] Design review subagent (reviewing-design-docs) was dispatched
- [ ] All critical/important findings fixed (if any)
- [ ] Assumption verification completed (Phase 2.5)

**Persist Design Decisions:** After design is approved, store key architectural decisions for future sessions:
```
memory_store_memories(memories='{"memories": [{"content": "Design decision for [feature]: [chosen approach]. Rationale: [why]. Alternatives considered: [list].", "memory_type": "decision", "tags": ["design", "[subsystem]", "[feature_slug]"], "citations": [{"file_path": "[design_doc_path]"}]}]}')
```

### Phase 2.5: Assumption Verification

After design review fixes, fact-check assumptions flagged by devil's advocate in Phase 1.6.

Dispatch subagent to invoke fact-checking skill with scope limited to:
- Assumptions marked UNVALIDATED or IMPLICIT by devil's advocate
- Claims in the design document that reference codebase patterns

This closes the loop: devil's advocate flags assumptions, fact-checking verifies them, design proceeds with evidence.

**Document Reconciliation (Post-Fact-Check):** If fact-checking invalidated assumptions or corrected claims, update both the understanding document and the design document to reflect verified facts. Remove or annotate any design decisions that were based on now-disproven assumptions.

### After Phase 3 (Implementation Planning):

```bash
ls ~/.local/spellbook/docs/<project-encoded>/plans/*-impl.md
# MUST contain: YYYY-MM-DD-[feature]-impl.md
```

- [ ] Implementation plan exists
- [ ] Plan review subagent (reviewing-impl-plans) was dispatched
- [ ] Execution mode determined (work_items/delegated/direct)

### During Phase 4 (for EACH task):

- [ ] TDD subagent (test-driven-development) dispatched
- [ ] Implementation completion verification done (inline audit prompt)
- [ ] Code review subagent (requesting-code-review) dispatched
- [ ] Fact-checking subagent dispatched

### After Phase 4 (all tasks complete):

- [ ] Comprehensive implementation audit done (inline audit prompt)
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Green mirage audit subagent (auditing-green-mirage) dispatched
- [ ] Comprehensive fact-checking done
- [ ] Finishing subagent (finishing-a-development-branch) dispatched

---

## MANDATORY: Pre-Dispatch Ritual

<CRITICAL>
Before EVERY Task() dispatch inside /develop or any of its sub-skills
(feature-config, feature-research, feature-discover, feature-design,
feature-implement), output the following block IN YOUR VISIBLE RESPONSE
(not in thinking, not summarized): the user must be able to read it.

```
## Phase Declaration
- Dispatching for: Phase {N}, sub-step {N.M} ({step name from dispatch table below})
- Single skill the subagent will invoke: {exact skill name}
- Single artifact this dispatch produces: {exact path or short description}
- This dispatch covers EXACTLY ONE row of the dispatch table below.
```

If you cannot fill all four fields with a SINGLE value (no "and", no "+",
no "plus also", no comma-separated list), you are about to commit
Pattern 6 (Phase Collapse). STOP. Decompose into N separate dispatches,
recite a Phase Declaration for each, and dispatch them sequentially.

### Banned Phrasings in Dispatch Prompts (mechanical scan)

If your draft Task() prompt contains ANY of these phrasings, the dispatch
is wrong by construction. Decompose before sending:

- "design + impl plan", "design and impl plan", "design plus plan"
- "implementation + gates", "impl plus gates", "implement and run gates"
- "all per-task gates", "combined gates", "batched gates"
- "plus commit", "and commit", "implement and commit"
- "end-to-end", "everything", "the whole flow", "wrap it up"
- Any phrasing that combines two distinct rows of the dispatch table
  (e.g., "design + review", "plan + review", "TDD + code review")

Operator phrasings that DO NOT authorize phase collapse (no exceptions):

- "wrap up", "and pause", "finish X items", "let's wrap this", "close out"
- "autonomous mode", "fully autonomous", "you decide"
- "the architecture is settled", "forks pre-resolved", "pre-validated"
- "STANDARD tier doesn't need all gates", "small change", "small extension"
- "save context", "save tokens", "context efficiency"

If you find yourself reading any of the above as license to combine rows,
that IS the rationalization (see Anti-Rationalization Framework below,
Patterns 3, 6, and 10). Run the prerequisite check, then dispatch one
row at a time.

The Phase Declaration block is not optional and not negotiable. The user
relies on it to verify in real time that you are not collapsing phases.
A dispatch without a preceding Phase Declaration is a process failure
even if the work product is correct.
</CRITICAL>

---

## CRITICAL: Subagent Dispatch Points

<CRITICAL>
The following steps MUST use subagents. Direct execution in main context is FORBIDDEN.
If you find yourself using Write, Edit, or Bash tools directly during these steps: STOP.
Dispatch a subagent instead.

If a subagent fails or returns empty results: re-dispatch with additional context. After 3 consecutive failures on the same step, STOP and ask the user before continuing.
</CRITICAL>

### Signs You Are Violating This Rule

- Use the Write tool to create implementation files
- Use the Edit tool to modify code
- Use Bash to run tests without a subagent wrapper
- Read files to "understand" then immediately write code

### What To Do Instead

```
Task:
  description: "[Brief description]"
  subagent_type: "[CURRENT_AGENT_TYPE]"  # yolo, yolo-focused, or general
  prompt: |
    First, invoke the [skill-name] skill using the Skill tool.
    Then follow its complete workflow.

    ## Context for the Skill
    [Provide context here]
```

**OpenCode:** Always use `CURRENT_AGENT_TYPE` (detected at session start) to ensure subagents inherit YOLO permissions.
</FORBIDDEN>

---

## Invariant Principles

1. **Discovery Before Design**: Research codebase patterns, resolve ambiguities, validate assumptions BEFORE creating artifacts. Uninformed design creates artifacts that contradict codebase patterns.

2. **Subagents Invoke Skills**: Every subagent prompt tells agent to invoke skill via Skill tool. Prompts provide CONTEXT only. Never duplicate skill instructions in prompts.

3. **Quality Gates Block Progress**: Each phase has mandatory verification. 100% score required to proceed. Bypass only with explicit user consent.

4. **Completion Means Evidence**: "Done" requires traced verification through code. Trust execution paths, not file names or comments.

5. **Autonomous Means Thorough**: In autonomous mode, treat suggestions as mandatory. Fix root causes, not symptoms. Choose highest-quality fixes.

## Anti-Rationalization Framework

<CRITICAL>
LLM executors are prone to constructing plausible-sounding arguments for skipping phases.
This section names the patterns and provides mechanical countermeasures.

If you catch yourself building a case for why a phase can be skipped: STOP.
That IS the rationalization. Run the prerequisite check instead.
</CRITICAL>

### Named Rationalization Patterns

| # | Pattern | Signal Phrases | Counter |
|---|---------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | **Scope Minimization** | "This is just a...", "It's only a...", "Simple change" | Run mechanical heuristics. Numbers decide, not prose. |
| 2 | **Expertise Override** | "I already know...", "Obviously we should..." | Knowledge does not replace process. Research validates assumptions. |
| 3 | **Time Pressure** | "To save time...", "For efficiency...", "We can skip this since..." | Shortcuts cause rework. 10-minute phase skip causes 2-hour debug. |
| 4 | **Similarity Shortcut** | "Just like the last feature...", "Same pattern as..." | Similar is not identical. Discovery finds unique edge cases. |
| 5 | **Competence Assertion** | "I'm confident...", "No need to check..." | Confidence is not evidence. Even experts need quality gates. |
| 6 | **Phase Collapse** | "I'll combine research and discovery...", "These are essentially the same..." | Phases have distinct outputs and quality gates. Collapsing skips gates. |
| 7 | **Escape Hatch Abuse** | "The user's description is basically a design doc..." | Escape hatches require EXPLICIT artifacts at SPECIFIC paths. Prose is not an artifact. |
| 8 | **Gate Elision** | "Gate X passed clean, so we can skip Gate Y" | Each gate validates a different dimension. Execute all 5 in order. |
| 9 | **Self-Review Substitution** | "I reviewed the code myself instead of invoking the skill" | Skills contain specialized logic. Self-review is not equivalent. Invoke the skill. |
| 10 | **Momentum Preservation** | "We're making good progress, let's not slow down with gates" | Gates exist because velocity without quality produces rework. Execute the gate. |

### Valid Skip Reasons (Exhaustive List)

The ONLY valid reasons to skip or shorten a phase:

1. **Escape hatch**: Real artifact at a real path, detected in Phase 0
2. **TRIVIAL tier**: Exits skill entirely (value-only change, zero behavioral impact, zero test impact)
3. **SIMPLE tier**: Follows the Simple path (has its own reduced but rigorous phases)
4. **Explicit user skip**: User said "skip this phase" with full awareness of what is being skipped

Any other reason is a rationalization. No exceptions.

### Enforcement Rule

```
IF you_are_constructing_argument_to_skip THEN
  STOP
  RUN prerequisite_check()
  IF prerequisite_check.passes THEN
    phase_is_required = true
  ELSE
    address_prerequisite_failure()
  END
END
```

---

## Phase Transition Protocol

<CRITICAL>
Every phase transition requires mechanical verification. No phase can be skipped
without a bash-verifiable reason.
</CRITICAL>

### Transition Verification

Before ANY phase transition:

1. Run the prerequisite check for the NEXT phase
2. Confirm the CURRENT phase's completion checklist is 100%
3. State the complexity tier and confirm routing is correct

### Anti-Skip Circuit Breaker

```bash
# Circuit Breaker Check
# Run this when tempted to skip any phase

echo "=== ANTI-SKIP CIRCUIT BREAKER ==="
echo "Phase being skipped: [PHASE_NAME]"
echo ""
echo "Valid skip reasons (check ALL that apply):"
echo "  [ ] Escape hatch artifact exists at specific path"
echo "  [ ] Complexity tier is TRIVIAL (exiting skill)"
echo "  [ ] Complexity tier is SIMPLE (following simple path)"
echo "  [ ] User explicitly said 'skip this phase'"
echo ""
echo "If NONE checked: phase skip is a RATIONALIZATION."
echo "Run the phase. Trust the process."
echo "================================="
```

If zero boxes are checked, the phase MUST be executed. There are no other valid reasons.

### Memory-Informed Classification

Before running complexity heuristics, call `memory_recall(query="complexity tier [domain_or_subsystem]")` to check if similar features in this area were previously classified. Use prior classifications as a calibration reference, not as a binding precedent.

### Complexity Upgrade Protocol

If during execution the task reveals greater complexity than classified:

1. **STOP** current work immediately
2. **RE-RUN** heuristic evaluation with new information
3. **PRESENT** updated classification to user
4. **GET** confirmation before continuing
5. **RESTART** from the appropriate phase if tier changed upward

**Detection Points:**
- Phase 0.7: Initial classification (existing)
- Phase 1.5: Scope Drift Check after discovery wizard (NEW)
- Phase 1.5: ARH SCOPE_EXPANSION during wizard (NEW)
- Phase 2: Design complexity exceeds tier (existing, clarified)

**STANDARD -> COMPLEX upgrade in Phase 1.5:**
When scope drift upgrades STANDARD to COMPLEX mid-discovery:
- Run `forge_project_init` inline with single-feature project
- Do NOT restart from Phase 0; continue discovery with COMPLEX constraints
- Rewrite understanding document to reflect expanded scope

---

## Skill Invocation Pattern

<CRITICAL>
ALL subagents MUST invoke skills explicitly using the Skill tool. Do NOT embed or duplicate skill instructions in subagent prompts.

**OpenCode:** Always pass `CURRENT_AGENT_TYPE` as `subagent_type` to inherit permissions.
</CRITICAL>

**Correct Pattern:**

```
Task:
  description: "[3-5 word summary]"
  subagent_type: "[CURRENT_AGENT_TYPE]"  # yolo, yolo-focused, or general
  prompt: |
    First, invoke the [skill-name] skill using the Skill tool.
    Then follow its complete workflow.

    ## Context for the Skill
    [Only the context the skill needs to do its job]
```

**WRONG Pattern:**

```
Task (or subagent simulation):
  prompt: |
    Use the [skill-name] skill to do X.
    [Then duplicating the skill's instructions here]  <-- WRONG
```

<CRITICAL>
### Subagent Skill Invocation Verification

After dispatching ANY subagent that should invoke a skill:

1. Check subagent output for skill invocation confirmation.
2. Pattern match: output MUST contain "Launching skill: [skill-name]" or equivalent.
3. If pattern not found: REJECT the result. Do NOT integrate. Do NOT trust the subagent's findings; treat them as if the work was never performed. The subagent may have inline-executed the skill from memory, which is a silent-fallback contract violation.
4. Re-dispatch using the canonical template in the `dispatching-parallel-agents` skill (Subagent Dispatch Template), which includes the silent-fallback prohibition and the Skill Availability by Agent Type table.
5. If re-dispatch also produces no "Launching skill:" line: verify the `subagent_type` actually has the Skill tool. `claude-code-guide` and `statusline-setup` do not. If the agent type is correct and the line is still missing, escalate to the user. Do not silently accept.

A subagent that reports "the skill is not available in this environment" without showing an attempted Skill tool call is making an untested claim. Reject it. Skills are delivered via system-reminder, NOT via the deferred-tools list, and the catalog is injected lazily after the first tool call. A subagent must attempt the call before declaring it impossible.

Anti-rationalization #9 (Self-Review Substitution) applies here.
</CRITICAL>

### Phase 4 Dispatch Discipline

<CRITICAL>
Every Phase 4 dispatch point follows this protocol:

1. **Pre-dispatch:** Verify previous gate passed (if any)
2. **Dispatch:** Include skill invocation requirement in subagent prompt
3. **Post-dispatch:** Verify gate artifact exists
4. **Record:** When token_enforcement is gate_level or every_step, record gate completion
5. **Advance:** Only after ALL gates pass, advance workflow token (if token_enforcement enabled)

Skipping ANY step is forbidden. See Anti-Rationalization patterns #8, #9, #10.
</CRITICAL>

**Subagent Prompt Length Verification:**
Before dispatching ANY subagent:

1. Count lines in subagent prompt
2. Estimate tokens: `lines * 7`
3. If > 200 lines and no valid justification: compress before dispatch
4. Subagent prompts should be short (< 150 lines) since they provide context and invoke skills, not instructions

## Reasoning Schema

<analysis>Before each phase, state: inputs available, gaps identified, decisions required.</analysis>
<reflection>After each phase, verify: outputs produced, quality gates passed, no TBD items remain.</reflection>

## Workflow Execution

This skill orchestrates feature implementation through 5 sequential commands.
Each command handles a specific phase and stores state for the next.

### Command Sequence

| Order | Command | Phase | Purpose | Tier |
|-------|---------|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | `/feature-config` | 0 | Configuration wizard, escape hatches, preferences, **complexity classification** | ALL |
| 2 | `/feature-research` | 1 | Research strategy, codebase exploration, quality scoring | STANDARD, COMPLEX |
| 3 | `/feature-discover` | 1.5 | Informed discovery, disambiguation, understanding document | STANDARD, COMPLEX |
| 4 | `/feature-design` | 2 | Design document creation and review | STANDARD, COMPLEX |
| 5 | `/feature-implement` | 3-4 | Implementation planning and execution | ALL (Simple skips Phase 3) |

### Execution Protocol

<CRITICAL>
Run commands IN ORDER. Each command depends on state from the previous.
Do NOT skip commands unless escape hatches allow it.
</CRITICAL>

1. **Start:** Run `/feature-config` to initialize session
2. **Research:** Run `/feature-research` after config complete
3. **Discover:** Run `/feature-discover` after research complete
4. **Design:** Run `/feature-design` after discovery complete (unless escape hatch)
5. **Implement:** Run `/feature-implement` after design complete (unless escape hatch)

### Tier-Based Routing

After `/feature-config` completes (including Phase 0.7):

**TRIVIAL tier:**
- Exit the skill entirely
- Log: "Task classified as TRIVIAL. No workflow needed. Proceed with direct implementation."

**SIMPLE tier:**
- Skip `/feature-research`, `/feature-discover`, `/feature-design`
- Run lightweight research inline (explore subagent, <=5 files, 1-paragraph summary)
- Create inline plan (<=5 numbered steps in conversation)
- Get user confirmation on plan
- Run `/feature-implement` (skips Phase 3, enters at Phase 4)
- TDD and code review subagents still required
- Fact-checking SKIPPED
- Green mirage audit REQUIRED (assertion quality enforcement applies to all tiers)

**STANDARD tier:** Run all commands in order.

**COMPLEX tier:** Run all commands in order. Execution mode analysis in Phase 3.4.5 determines work item decomposition. Large features are split into work items with prompt files, not work packets.

### Simple Path Guardrails

| Guardrail | Limit | Exceeded Action |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Research files read | 5 | Upgrade to Standard, restart at Phase 1 |
| Research output | 1 paragraph | Upgrade to Standard, restart at Phase 1 |
| Plan steps | 5 | Upgrade to Standard, restart at Phase 3 |
| Implementation files | 5 | Pause, re-classify, restart if upgraded |
| Test files | 3 | Pause, re-classify, restart if upgraded |

If ANY guardrail is hit, trigger the Complexity Upgrade Protocol.

### Escape Hatch Routing

| Escape Hatch                     | Skip Commands                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design doc with "treat as ready" | Skip `/feature-design`                                           |
| Design doc with "review first"   | Run `/feature-design` starting at 2.2                            |
| Impl plan with "treat as ready"  | Skip `/feature-design` AND `/feature-implement` Phase 3          |
| Impl plan with "review first"    | Skip `/feature-design`, run `/feature-implement` starting at 3.2 |

### State Persistence

Commands share state via these session variables:

- `SESSION_PREFERENCES` - User workflow preferences (from Phase 0)
- `SESSION_CONTEXT` - Research findings, design context (built across phases)

### STOP AND VERIFY Markers

Each command ends with a STOP AND VERIFY section. These are checkpoints.
Do NOT proceed to the next command until ALL items are checked.
